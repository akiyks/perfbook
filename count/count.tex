\Epigraph{As easy as 1, 2, 3!}{\emph{Unknown}}

Counting is perhaps the simplest and most natural thing a computer can do.
However, counting efficiently and scalably on a large
shared-memory multiprocessor can be quite challenging.
Furthermore, the simplicity of the underlying concept of counting
allows us to explore the fundamental issues of concurrency without
the distractions
of elaborate data structures or complex synchronization primitives.
Counting therefore provides an excellent introduction to
parallel programming.

This chapter covers a number of special cases for which there are simple,
fast, and scalable counting algorithms.
But first, let us find out how much you already know about concurrent
counting.

\EQuickQuiz{
	Why should efficient and scalable counting be hard???
	After all, computers have special hardware for the sole purpose
	of doing counting!!!
}\EQuickQuizAnswer{
	Because the straightforward counting algorithms, for example,
	atomic operations on a shared counter, either are slow and scale
	badly, or are inaccurate, as will be seen in
	Section~\ref{sec:count:Why Isn't Concurrent Counting Trivial?}.

	{\bfseries Network-packet counting problem.}
	Suppose that you need to collect statistics on the number
	of networking packets transmitted and received.
	Packets might be transmitted or received by any CPU on the system.
	Suppose further that your system is capable of
	handling millions of packets per second per CPU, and that
	a systems-monitoring package reads the count every five seconds.
	How would you implement this counter?
}\EQuickQuizAnswer{
	Hint: The act of updating the counter must be blazingly
	fast, but because the counter is read out only about once
	in five million updates, the act of reading out the counter can be
	quite slow.
	In addition, the value read out normally need not be all that
	accurate---after all, since the counter is updated a thousand
	times per millisecond, we should be able to work with a value
	that is within a few thousand counts of the ``true value'',
	whatever ``true value'' might mean in this context.
	However, the value read out should maintain roughly the same
	absolute error over time.
	For example, a 1\,\% error might be just fine when the count
	is on the order of a million or so, but might be absolutely
	unacceptable once the count reaches a trillion.

	Suppose further that the structures are short-lived, the
	limit is rarely exceeded, and a ``sloppy'' approximate limit
	is acceptable.
}\EQuickQuizAnswer{
	Hint: The act of updating the counter must again be blazingly
	fast, but the counter is read out each time that the
	counter is increased.
	However, the value read out need not be accurate

	{\bfseries Removable I/O device access-count problem.}
	Suppose that you need to maintain a reference count on a

	can tell the user when it is safe to remove the device.
	As usual, the user indicates a desire to remove the device, and
	the system tells the user when it is safe to do so.
}\EQuickQuizAnswer{
	Hint: Yet again, the act of updating the counter must be blazingly
	fast and scalable in order to avoid slowing down I/O operations,
	but because the counter is read out only when the
	user wishes to remove the device, the counter read-out
	operation can be extremely slow.
	Furthermore, there is no need to be able to read out
	the counter at all unless the user has already indicated
	a desire to remove the device.
	In addition, the value read out need not be accurate
	\emph{except} that it absolutely must distinguish perfectly
	between non-zero and zero values, and even then only when
	the device is in the process of being removed.
	However, once it has read out a zero value, it must act
	to keep the value at zero until it has taken some action
	to prevent subsequent threads from gaining access to the
	device being removed.

\section{Why Isn't Concurrent Counting Trivial?}
\label{sec:count:Why Isn't Concurrent Counting Trivial?}
%
\epigraph{Seek simplicity, and distrust it.}{\emph{Alfred North Whitehead}}

Let's start with something simple, for example, the straightforward
use of arithmetic shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:count:Just Count!} (\path{count_nonatomic.c}).
\begin{fcvref}[ln:count:count_nonatomic:inc-read]
Here, we have a counter on line~\lnref{counter}, we increment it on
line~\lnref{inc}, and we read out its value on line~\lnref{read}.
What could be simpler?
\end{fcvref}

\QuickQuiz{
	One thing that could be simpler is \co{++} instead of that
	concatenation of \co{READ_ONCE()} and \co{WRITE_ONCE()}.
	Why all that extra typing???
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	See \cref{sec:toolsoftrade:Shared-Variable Shenanigans}
	on page~\pageref{sec:toolsoftrade:Shared-Variable Shenanigans}
	for more information on how the compiler can cause trouble,
	as well as how \co{READ_ONCE()} and \co{WRITE_ONCE()} can avoid
	this trouble.
}\QuickQuizEnd

\label{lst:count:Just Count!}
\end{listing}

This approach has the additional advantage of being blazingly fast if
you are doing lots of reading and almost no incrementing, and on small
systems, the performance is excellent.

There is just one large fly in the ointment: this approach can lose
counts.
On my six-core x86 laptop, a short run invoked \co{inc_count()}
285,824,000 times, but the final value of the counter was only
35,385,525.
Although approximation does have a large place in computing, loss of
87\,\% of the counts is a bit excessive.

\QuickQuizSeries{%
\QuickQuizB{
	But can't a smart compiler prove that
	line~\ref{ln:count:count_nonatomic:inc-read:inc}
	of
	Listing~\ref{lst:count:Just Count!}
	is equivalent to the \co{++} operator and produce an x86
	add-to-memory instruction?
	And won't the CPU cache cause this to be atomic?
}\QuickQuizAnswerB{
	Although the \co{++} operator \emph{could} be atomic, there
	is no requirement that it be so unless it is applied to a
	C11 \co{_Atomic} variable.
	And indeed, in the absence of \co{_Atomic}, \GCC\ often
	chooses to load the value to a register, increment
	the register, then store the value to memory, which is
	decidedly non-atomic.

	Furthermore, note the volatile casts in
	\co{READ_ONCE()} and \co{WRITE_ONCE()}, which tell
	the compiler that the location might well be an MMIO
	device register.
	Because MMIO registers are not cached, it would be unwise for
	the compiler to assume that the increment operation is atomic.

\QuickQuizE{
	The 8-figure accuracy on the number of failures indicates
	that you really did test this.
	Why would it be necessary to test such a trivial program,
	especially when the bug is easily seen by inspection?
}\QuickQuizAnswerE{
	Not only are there very few
	trivial parallel programs, and most days I am
	not so sure that there are many trivial sequential programs, either.

	No matter how small or simple the program, if you haven't tested
	it, it does not work.
	And even if you have tested it, Murphy's Law says that there will
	be at least a few bugs still lurking.

	Furthermore, while proofs of correctness certainly do have their
	place, they never will replace testing, including the
	\path{counttorture.h} test setup used here.
	After all, proofs are only as good as the assumptions that they
	are based on.
	Finally, proofs can be every bit as buggy as are programs!

The straightforward way to count accurately is to use \IX{atomic} operations,
as shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:count:Just Count Atomically!} (\path{count_atomic.c}).
\begin{fcvref}[ln:count:count_atomic:inc-read]
Line~\lnref{counter} defines an atomic variable,
line~\lnref{inc} atomically increments it, and
line~\lnref{read} reads it out.
\end{fcvref}
Because this is atomic, it keeps perfect count.
However, it is slower: on my six-core x86 laptop, it is more than
twenty times slower than non-atomic increment, even
when only a single thread is incrementing.\footnote{
	Interestingly enough, non-atomically incrementing a counter will
	advance the counter more quickly than atomically incrementing
	the counter.
	Of course, if your only goal is to make the counter increase
	quickly, an easier approach is to simply assign a large value
	to the counter.
	Nevertheless, there is likely to be a role for algorithms that
	use carefully relaxed notions of correctness in order to gain
	greater performance and
	scalability~\cite{Andrews91textbook,Arcangeli03,10.5555/3241639.3241645,DavidUngar2011unsync}.}

This poor performance should not be a surprise, given the discussion in
Chapter~\ref{chp:Hardware and its Habits},
nor should it be a surprise that the performance of atomic increment
gets slower as the number of CPUs and threads increase, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Atomic Increment Scalability on x86}.
In this figure, the horizontal dashed line resting on the x~axis
is the ideal performance that would be achieved
by a perfectly scalable algorithm: with such an algorithm, a given
increment would incur the same overhead that it would in a single-threaded
program.
Atomic increment of a single global variable is clearly
decidedly non-ideal, and gets multiple orders of magnitude worse with
additional CPUs.

\QuickQuizSeries{%
\QuickQuizB{
	Why doesn't the horizontal dashed line on the x~axis meet the
	diagonal line at $x=1$?
}\QuickQuizAnswerB{
	Because of the overhead of the atomic operation.
	The dashed line on the x~axis represents the overhead of
	a single \emph{non-atomic} increment.
	After all, an \emph{ideal} algorithm would not only scale
	linearly, it would also incur no performance penalty compared
	to single-threaded code.

	This level of idealism may seem severe, but if it is good
	enough for \ppl{Linus}{Torvalds}, it is good enough for you.
}\QuickQuizEndB
%
\QuickQuizE{
	But atomic increment is still pretty fast.
	And incrementing a single variable in a tight loop sounds
	pretty unrealistic to me, after all, most of the program's
	execution should be devoted to actually doing work, not accounting
	for the work it has done!
	Why should I care about making this go faster?
}\QuickQuizAnswerE{
	In many cases, atomic increment will in fact be fast enough
	for you.
	In those cases, you should by all means use atomic increment.
	That said, there are many real-world situations where
	more elaborate counting algorithms are required.
	The canonical example of such a situation is counting packets
	and bytes in highly optimized networking stacks, where it is
	all too easy to find much of the execution time going into
	these sorts of accounting tasks, especially on large
	multiprocessors.

	In addition, as noted at the beginning of this chapter,
	counting provides an excellent view of the
	issues encountered in shared-memory parallel programs.

\end{figure}

For another perspective on global atomic increment, consider
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Data Flow For Global Atomic Increment}.
In order for each CPU to get a chance to increment a given
global variable, the \IX{cache line} containing that variable must
circulate among all the CPUs, as shown by the red arrows.
Such circulation will take significant time, resulting in
the poor performance seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Atomic Increment Scalability on x86},
which might be thought of as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Waiting to Count}.
The following sections discuss high-performance counting, which
avoids the delays inherent in such circulation.

\QuickQuiz{
	But why can't CPU designers simply ship the addition operation to the
	data, avoiding the need to circulate the cache line containing
	the global variable being incremented?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	It might well be possible to do this in some cases.
	However, there are a few complications:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	If the value of the variable is required, then the
		thread will be forced to wait for the operation
		to be shipped to the data, and then for the result
		to be shipped back.
	\item	If the atomic increment must be ordered with respect
		to prior and/or subsequent operations, then the thread
		will be forced to wait for the operation to be shipped
		to the data, and for an indication that the operation
		completed to be shipped back.
	\item	Shipping operations among CPUs will likely require
		more lines in the system interconnect, which will consume
		more die area and more electrical power.
	\end{enumerate}
	But what if neither of the first two conditions holds?
	Then you should think carefully about the algorithms discussed
	in Section~\ref{sec:count:Statistical Counters}, which achieve
	near-ideal performance on commodity hardware.

\centering
\resizebox{3in}{!}{\includegraphics{count/GlobalTreeInc}}
\caption{Data Flow For Global Combining-Tree Atomic Increment}
\label{fig:count:Data Flow For Global Combining-Tree Atomic Increment}
\end{figure}

	If either or both of the first two conditions hold, there is
	\emph{some} hope for improved hardware.
	One could imagine the hardware implementing a combining tree,
	so that the increment requests from multiple CPUs are combined
	by the hardware into a single addition when the combined request
	reaches the hardware.
	The hardware could also apply an order to the requests, thus
	returning to each CPU the return value corresponding to its
	particular atomic increment.
	This results in instruction latency that varies as $\O{\log N}$,
	where $N$ is the number of CPUs, as shown in
	Figure~\ref{fig:count:Data Flow For Global Combining-Tree Atomic Increment}.
	And CPUs with this sort of hardware optimization started to
	appear in 2011.

	This is a great improvement over the $\O{N}$ performance
	of current hardware shown in
	Figure~\ref{fig:count:Data Flow For Global Atomic Increment},
	and it is possible that hardware latencies might decrease
	further if innovations such as three-dimensional fabrication prove
	practical.
	Nevertheless, we will see that in some important special cases,
	software can do \emph{much} better.

\section{Statistical Counters}
\label{sec:count:Statistical Counters}
%
\epigraph{Facts are stubborn things, but statistics are pliable.}
	 {\emph{Mark Twain}}

This section covers the common special case of statistical counters, where
the count is updated extremely frequently and the value is read out
rarely, if ever.
These will be used to solve the network-packet counting problem
posed in \QuickQuizRef{\QcountQstatcnt}.

\subsection{Design}

Statistical counting is typically handled by providing a counter per
thread (or CPU, when running in the kernel), so that each thread
updates its own counter, as was foreshadowed in
Section~\ref{sec:toolsoftrade:Per-CPU Variables}
on page~\pageref{sec:toolsoftrade:Per-CPU Variables}.
The aggregate value of the counters is read out by simply summing up
all of the threads' counters,
relying on the commutative and associative properties of addition.
This is an example of the Data Ownership pattern that will be introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:SMPdesign:Data Ownership}
on page~\pageref{sec:SMPdesign:Data Ownership}.

\QuickQuiz{
	But doesn't the fact that C's ``integers'' are limited in size
	complicate things?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	No, because modulo addition is still commutative and associative.
	At least as long as you use unsigned integers.
	Recall that in the C standard, overflow of signed integers results
	in undefined behavior, never mind the fact that machines that
	do anything other than wrap on overflow are quite rare these days.
	Unfortunately, compilers frequently carry out optimizations that
	assume that signed integers will not overflow, so if your code
	allows signed integers to overflow, you can run into trouble
	even on modern twos-complement hardware.

	That said, one potential source of additional complexity arises
	when attempting to gather (say) a 64-bit sum from 32-bit
	per-thread counters.
	Dealing with this added complexity is left as
	an exercise for the reader, for whom some of the techniques
	introduced later in this chapter could be quite helpful.
}\QuickQuizEnd

\subsection{Array-Based Implementation}
\label{sec:count:Array-Based Implementation}

One way to provide per-thread variables is to allocate an array with
one element per
thread (presumably cache aligned and padded to avoid false sharing).

\QuickQuiz{
	An array???
	But doesn't that limit the number of threads?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	It can, and in this toy implementation, it does.
	But it is not that hard to come up with an alternative
	implementation that permits an arbitrary number of threads,
	for example, using \GCC's \co{__thread} facility,
	as shown in
	Section~\ref{sec:count:Per-Thread-Variable-Based Implementation}.
}\QuickQuizEnd

\begin{listing}
\input{CodeSamples/count/count_stat@inc-read.fcv}
\caption{Array-Based Per-Thread Statistical Counters}
\label{lst:count:Array-Based Per-Thread Statistical Counters}
\end{listing}

Such an array can be wrapped into per-thread primitives, as shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:count:Array-Based Per-Thread Statistical Counters}
(\path{count_stat.c}).
\begin{fcvref}[ln:count:count_stat:inc-read]
Line~\lnref{define} defines an array containing a set of per-thread counters of
type \co{unsigned long} named, creatively enough, \co{counter}.

\Clnrefrange{inc:b}{inc:e}
show a function that increments the counters, using the
\co{__get_thread_var()} primitive to locate the currently running
thread's element of the \co{counter} array.
Because this element is modified only by the corresponding thread,
non-atomic increment suffices.
However, this code uses \co{WRITE_ONCE()} to prevent destructive compiler
optimizations.
For but one example, the compiler is within its rights to use a
to-be-stored-to location as temporary storage, thus writing what
would be for all intents and purposes garbage to that location
just before doing the desired store.
This could of course be rather confusing to anything attempting to
read out the count.
The use of \co{WRITE_ONCE()} prevents this optimization and others besides.

\QuickQuiz{
	What other nasty optimizations could \GCC\ apply?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	See \cref{sec:toolsoftrade:Shared-Variable Shenanigans,%
	sec:memorder:Compile-Time Consternation}
	for more information.
	One nasty optimization would be to apply common subexpression
	elimination to successive calls to the \co{read_count()} function,
	which might come as a surprise to code expecting changes in the
	values returned from successive calls to that function.
}\QuickQuizEnd

\Clnrefrange{read:b}{read:e}
show a function that reads out the aggregate value of the counter,
using the \co{for_each_thread()} primitive to iterate over the list of
currently running threads, and using the \co{per_thread()} primitive
to fetch the specified thread's counter.
This code also uses \co{READ_ONCE()} to ensure that the compiler doesn't
optimize these loads into oblivion.
For but one example, a pair of consecutive calls to \co{read_count()}
might be inlined, and an intrepid optimizer might notice that the same
locations were being summed and thus incorrectly conclude that it would
be simply wonderful to sum them once and use the resulting value twice.
This sort of optimization might be rather frustrating to people expecting
later \co{read_count()} calls to account for the activities of other
threads.
The use of \co{READ_ONCE()} prevents this optimization and others besides.

	How does the per-thread \co{counter} variable in

	global variables is zero, unless they are explicitly initialized,
	thus implicitly initializing all the instances of \co{counter}

\centering
\resizebox{3in}{!}{\includegraphics{count/PerThreadInc}}
\caption{Data Flow For Per-Thread Increment}
\label{fig:count:Data Flow For Per-Thread Increment}
\end{figure}

This approach scales linearly with increasing number of updater threads
invoking \co{inc_count()}.
As is shown by the green arrows on each CPU in
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Data Flow For Per-Thread Increment},
the reason for this is that each CPU can make rapid progress incrementing
its thread's variable, without any expensive cross-system communication.
As such, this section solves the network-packet counting problem presented
at the beginning of this chapter.

\QuickQuiz{
	The read operation takes time to sum up the per-thread values,
	and during that time, the counter could well be changing.
	This means that the value returned by
	\co{read_count()} in
	Listing~\ref{lst:count:Array-Based Per-Thread Statistical Counters}
	will not necessarily be exact.
	Assume that the counter is being incremented at rate
	$r$ counts per unit time, and that \co{read_count()}'s
	execution consumes $\Delta$ units of time.
	What is the expected error in the return value?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Let's do worst-case analysis first, followed by a less
	conservative analysis.

	In the worst case, the read operation completes immediately,
	but is then delayed for $\Delta$ time units before returning,
	in which case the worst-case error is simply $r \Delta$.

	This worst-case behavior is rather unlikely, so let us instead
	consider the case where the reads from each of the $N$
	counters is spaced equally over the time period $\Delta$.
	There will be $N+1$ intervals of duration $\frac{\Delta}{N+1}$
	between the $N$ reads.
	The error due to the delay after the read from the last thread's
	counter will be given by $\frac{r \Delta}{N \left( N + 1 \right)}$,
	the second-to-last thread's counter by
	$\frac{2 r \Delta}{N \left( N + 1 \right)}$,
	the third-to-last by
	$\frac{3 r \Delta}{N \left( N + 1 \right)}$,
	and so on.
	The total error is given by the sum of the errors due to the
	reads from each thread's counter, which is:

	\begin{equation}
		\frac{r \Delta}{N \left( N + 1 \right)}
			\sum_{i = 1}^N i
	\end{equation}

	Expressing the summation in closed form yields:

	\begin{equation}
		\frac{r \Delta}{N \left( N + 1 \right)}
			\frac{N \left( N + 1 \right)}{2}
	\end{equation}

	Canceling yields the intuitively expected result:

	\begin{equation}
		\frac{r \Delta}{2}
	\label{eq:count:CounterErrorAverage}
	\end{equation}

	It is important to remember that error continues accumulating
	as the caller executes code making use of the count returned
	by the read operation.
	For example, if the caller spends time $t$ executing some
	computation based on the result of the returned count, the
	worst-case error will have increased to $r \left(\Delta + t\right)$.

	The expected error will have similarly increased to:

	\begin{equation}
		r \left( \frac{\Delta}{2} + t \right)
	\end{equation}

	Of course, it is sometimes unacceptable for the counter to
	continue incrementing during the read operation.
	Section~\ref{sec:count:Applying Exact Limit Counters}
	discusses a way to handle this situation.

	Thus far, we have been considering a counter that is only
	increased, never decreased.
	If the counter value is being changed by $r$ counts per unit
	time, but in either direction, we should expect the error
	to reduce.
	However, the worst case is unchanged because although the
	counter \emph{could} move in either direction, the worst
	case is when the read operation completes immediately,
	but then is delayed for $\Delta$ time units, during which
	time all the changes in the counter's value move it in
	the same direction, again giving us an absolute error
	of $r \Delta$.

	There are a number of ways to compute the average error,
	based on a variety of assumptions about the patterns of
	increments and decrements.
	For simplicity, let's assume that the $f$ fraction of
	the operations are decrements, and that the error of interest
	is the deviation from the counter's long-term trend line.
	Under this assumption, if $f$ is less than or equal to 0.5,
	each decrement will be canceled by an increment, so that
	$2f$ of the operations will cancel each other, leaving
	$1-2f$ of the operations being uncanceled increments.
	On the other hand, if $f$ is greater than 0.5, $1-f$ of
	the decrements are canceled by increments, so that the
	counter moves in the negative direction by $-1+2\left(1-f\right)$,
	which simplifies to $1-2f$, so that the counter moves an average
	of $1-2f$ per operation in either case.
	Therefore, that the long-term
	movement of the counter is given by $\left( 1-2f \right) r$.
	Plugging this into
	Equation~\ref{eq:count:CounterErrorAverage} yields:

	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\left( 1 - 2 f \right) r \Delta}{2}
	\end{equation}

	All that aside, in most uses of statistical counters, the
	error in the value returned by \co{read_count()} is
	irrelevant.
	This irrelevance is due to the fact that the time required
	for \co{read_count()} to execute is normally extremely
	small compared to the time interval between successive
	calls to \co{read_count()}.

However, many implementations provide cheaper mechanisms for
per-thread data that are free from arbitrary array-size limits.
This is the topic of the next section.

\subsection{Per-Thread-Variable-Based Implementation}
\label{sec:count:Per-Thread-Variable-Based Implementation}

\GCC\ provides an \co{__thread} storage class that provides
per-thread storage.
This can be used as shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:count:Per-Thread Statistical Counters} (\path{count_end.c})
to implement
a statistical counter that not only scales well and avoids arbitrary
thread-number limits, but that also incurs little or no performance
penalty to incrementers compared to simple non-atomic increment.

\begin{listing}
\input{CodeSamples/count/count_end@whole.fcv}
\caption{Per-Thread Statistical Counters}
\label{lst:count:Per-Thread Statistical Counters}
\end{listing}

\begin{fcvref}[ln:count:count_end:whole]
\Clnrefrange{var:b}{var:e} define needed variables:
\co{counter} is the per-thread counter
variable, the \co{counterp[]} array allows threads to access each others'
counters, \co{finalcount} accumulates the total as individual threads exit,
and \co{final_mutex} coordinates between threads accumulating the total
value of the counter and exiting threads.
\end{fcvref}

\QuickQuiz{
	Doesn't that explicit \co{counterp} array in
	\cref{lst:count:Per-Thread Statistical Counters}
	reimpose an arbitrary limit on the number of threads?
	Why doesn't \GCC\ provide a \co{per_thread()} interface, similar
	to the Linux kernel's \co{per_cpu()} primitive, to allow
	threads to more easily access each others' per-thread variables?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Why indeed?

	To be fair, \GCC\ faces some challenges that the Linux kernel
	gets to ignore.
	When a user-level thread exits, its per-thread variables all
	disappear, which complicates the problem of per-thread-variable
	access, particularly before the advent of user-level RCU
	(see Section~\ref{sec:defer:Read-Copy Update (RCU)}).
	In contrast, in the Linux kernel, when a CPU goes offline,
	that CPU's per-CPU variables remain mapped and accessible.

	Similarly, when a new user-level thread is created, its
	per-thread variables suddenly come into existence.
	In contrast, in the Linux kernel, all per-CPU variables are
	mapped and initialized at boot time, regardless of whether
	the corresponding CPU exists yet, or indeed, whether the
	corresponding CPU will ever exist.

	A key limitation that the Linux kernel imposes is a compile-time
	maximum bound on the number of CPUs, namely, \co{CONFIG_NR_CPUS},
	along with a typically tighter boot-time bound of \co{nr_cpu_ids}.
	In contrast, in user space, there is not necessarily a hard-coded
	upper limit on the number of threads.

	Of course, both environments must handle dynamically loaded
	code (dynamic libraries in user space, kernel modules in the
	Linux kernel), which increases the complexity of per-thread
	variables.

	These complications make it significantly harder for user-space
	environments to provide access to other threads' per-thread
	variables.
	Nevertheless, such access is highly useful, and it is hoped
	that it will someday appear.

	In the meantime, textbook examples such as this one can use
	arrays whose limits can be easily adjusted by the user.
	Alternatively, such arrays can be dynamically allocated and
	expanded as needed at runtime.
	Finally, variable-length data structures such as linked
	lists can be used, as is done in the userspace RCU
	library~\cite{MathieuDesnoyers2009URCU,MathieuDesnoyers2012URCU}.
	This last approach can also reduce false sharing in some cases.

Line~\lnref{add} adds this thread's \co{counter} to the global

and then line~\lnref{NULL} \co{NULL}s out its \co{counterp[]} array entry.
A subsequent call to \co{read_count()} will see the exiting thread's
count in the global \co{finalcount}, and will skip the exiting thread
when sequencing through the \co{counterp[]} array, thus obtaining
the correct total.

This approach gives updaters almost exactly the same performance as
a non-atomic add, and also scales linearly.
On the other hand, concurrent reads contend for a single global lock,
and therefore perform poorly and scale abysmally.
However, this is not a problem for statistical counters, where incrementing
happens often and readout happens almost never.
Of course, this approach is considerably more complex than the
array-based scheme, due to the fact that a given thread's per-thread
variables vanish when that thread exits.

Both the array-based and \co{__thread}-based approaches offer excellent
update-side performance and scalability.
However, these benefits result in large read-side expense for large
numbers of threads.
The next section shows one way to reduce read-side expense while
still retaining the update-side scalability.

\subsection{Eventually Consistent Implementation}
\label{sec:count:Eventually Consistent Implementation}

One way to retain update-side scalability while greatly improving
read-side performance is to weaken consistency requirements.
The counting algorithm in the previous section is guaranteed to
return a value between the value that an ideal counter would have
taken on near the beginning of \co{read_count()}'s execution and
that near the end of \co{read_count()}'s execution.
\emph{Eventual consistency}~\cite{WernerVogels:2009:EventuallyConsistent}
provides a weaker
guarantee: in absence of calls to \co{inc_count()}, calls to
\co{read_count()} will eventually return an accurate count.

We exploit eventual consistency by maintaining a global counter.
However, updaters only manipulate their per-thread counters.
A separate thread is provided to transfer counts from the per-thread
counters to the global counter.
Readers simply access the value of the global counter.
If updaters are active, the value used by the readers will be out of
date, however, once updates cease, the global counter will eventually
converge on the true value---hence this approach qualifies as
eventually consistent.

\caption{Array-Based Per-Thread Eventually Consistent Counters}
\label{lst:count:Array-Based Per-Thread Eventually Consistent Counters}
\end{listing}

\begin{fcvref}[ln:count:count_stat_eventual:whole]
The implementation is shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:count:Array-Based Per-Thread Eventually Consistent Counters}
(\path{count_stat_eventual.c}).
\Clnrefrange{per_thr_cnt}{glb_cnt}
show the per-thread variable and the global variable that
track the counter's value, and line~\lnref{stopflag} shows \co{stopflag}
which is used to coordinate termination (for the case where we want
to terminate the program with an accurate counter value).
The \co{inc_count()} function shown on
\clnrefrange{inc:b}{inc:e} is similar to its
counterpart in
Listing~\ref{lst:count:Array-Based Per-Thread Statistical Counters}.
The \co{read_count()} function shown on
\clnrefrange{read:b}{read:e} simply returns the
value of the \co{global_count} variable.

However, the \co{count_init()} function on
\clnrefrange{init:b}{init:e}
creates the \co{eventual()} thread shown on
\clnrefrange{eventual:b}{eventual:e}, which
cycles through all the threads,
summing the per-thread local \co{counter} and storing the
sum to the \co{global_count} variable.
The \co{eventual()} thread waits an arbitrarily chosen one millisecond
between passes.

The \co{count_cleanup()} function on
\clnrefrange{cleanup:b}{cleanup:e} coordinates termination.
The calls to \co{smp_mb()} here and in \co{eventual()} ensure
that all updates to \co{global_count} are visible to code following
the call to \co{count_cleanup()}.

This approach gives extremely fast counter read-out while still
supporting linear counter-update scalability.
However, this excellent read-side performance and update-side scalability
comes at the cost of the additional thread running \co{eventual()}.

	\co{counter} variables periodically in order to avoid overflow,
	which does require atomic instructions.
	It is extremely important to note that this zeroing cannot
	be delayed too long or overflow of the smaller per-thread
	variables will result.
	This approach therefore imposes real-time requirements on the

	When counting packets, the counter is only incremented by the

	On the other hand, when counting bytes, the counter might

	Why does this matter?
	Because in the increment-by-one case, the value returned will
	be exact in the sense that the counter must necessarily have
	taken on that value at some point in time, even if it is impossible
	to say precisely when that point occurred.
	In contrast, when counting bytes, two different threads might

Given what has been presented in this section, you should now be able

\section{Approximate Limit Counters}
\label{sec:count:Approximate Limit Counters}
%
\epigraph{An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal
	  more than an exact answer to an approximate problem.}
	 {\emph{John Tukey}}

Another special case of counting involves limit-checking.
For example, as noted in the approximate structure-allocation limit
problem in \QuickQuizRef{\QcountQapproxcnt},
suppose that you need to maintain a count of the number of
structures allocated in order to fail any allocations once the number
of structures in use exceeds a limit, in this case, 10,000.
Suppose further that these structures are short-lived, that this
limit is rarely exceeded, and that this limit is approximate in
that it is OK to exceed it sometimes by some bounded amount
(see Section~\ref{sec:count:Exact Limit Counters}
if you instead need the limit to be exact).

\subsection{Design}

One possible design for limit counters is to divide the limit of 10,000
by the number of threads, and give each thread a fixed pool of structures.
For example, given 100 threads, each thread would manage its own pool
of 100 structures.
This approach is simple, and in some cases works well, but it does not
handle the common case where a given structure is allocated by one
thread and freed by another~\cite{McKenney93}.
On the one hand, if a given thread takes credit for any structures it
frees, then the thread doing most of the allocating runs out
of structures, while the threads doing most of the freeing have lots
of credits that they cannot use.
On the other hand, if freed structures are credited to the CPU that
allocated them, it will be necessary for CPUs to manipulate each
others' counters, which will require expensive \IX{atomic} instructions
or other means of communicating between threads.\footnote{
	That said, if each structure will always be freed
	by the same CPU (or thread) that allocated it, then
	this simple partitioning approach works extremely well.}

In short, for many important workloads, we cannot fully partition the counter.
Given that partitioning the counters was what brought the excellent
update-side performance for the three schemes discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:count:Statistical Counters}, this might be grounds
for some pessimism.
However, the eventually consistent algorithm presented in
Section~\ref{sec:count:Eventually Consistent Implementation}
provides an interesting hint.
Recall that this algorithm kept two sets of books, a
per-thread \co{counter} variable for updaters and a \co{global_count}
variable for readers, with an \co{eventual()} thread that periodically
updated \co{global_count} to be eventually consistent with the values
of the per-thread \co{counter}.
The per-thread \co{counter} perfectly partitioned the counter value, while
\co{global_count} kept the full value.

For limit counters, we can use a variation on this theme where we
\emph{partially partition} the counter.
For example, consider four threads with each having not only a
per-thread \co{counter}, but also a per-thread maximum value (call
it \co{countermax}).

But then what happens if a given thread needs to increment its
\co{counter}, but \co{counter} is equal to its \co{countermax}?
The trick here is to move half of that thread's \co{counter} value
to a \co{globalcount}, then increment \co{counter}.
For example, if a given thread's \co{counter} and \co{countermax}
variables were both equal to 10, we do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Acquire a global lock.
\item	Add five to \co{globalcount}.
\item	To balance out the addition, subtract five from this
	thread's \co{counter}.
\item	Release the global lock.
\item	Increment this thread's \co{counter}, resulting in a value of six.
\end{enumerate}

Although this procedure still requires a global lock, that lock need only be
acquired once for every five increment operations, greatly reducing
that lock's level of \IXalt{contention}{lock contention}.
We can reduce this contention as low as we wish by increasing the
value of \co{countermax}.
However, the corresponding penalty for increasing the value of
\co{countermax} is reduced accuracy of \co{globalcount}.
To see this, note that on a four-CPU system, if \co{countermax}
is equal to ten, \co{globalcount} will be in error by at most
40 counts.
In contrast, if \co{countermax} is increased to 100, \co{globalcount}
might be in error by as much as 400 counts.

This raises the question of just how much we care about \co{globalcount}'s
deviation from the aggregate value of the counter, where this aggregate value
is the sum of \co{globalcount} and each thread's \co{counter} variable.
The answer to this question depends on how far the aggregate value is
from the counter's limit (call it \co{globalcountmax}).
The larger the difference between these two values, the larger \co{countermax}
can be without risk of exceeding the \co{globalcountmax} limit.
This means that the
value of a given thread's \co{countermax} variable can be set
based on this difference.
When far from the limit, the \co{countermax} per-thread variables are
set to large values to optimize for performance and scalability, while
when close to the limit, these same variables are set to small values
to minimize the error in the checks against the \co{globalcountmax} limit.

This design is an example of \emph{parallel fastpath}, which is an important
design pattern in which the common case executes with no expensive
instructions and no interactions between threads, but where occasional
use is also made of a more conservatively designed
(and higher overhead) global algorithm.
This design pattern is covered in more detail in
Section~\ref{sec:SMPdesign:Parallel Fastpath}.

corresponding thread's local counter and the upper bound on that
counter, respectively.
The \co{globalcountmax} variable on
line~\lnref{globalcountmax} contains the upper
bound for the aggregate counter, and the \co{globalcount} variable
on line~\lnref{globalcount} is the global counter.
The sum of \co{globalcount} and each thread's \co{counter} gives
the aggregate value of the overall counter.
The \co{globalreserve} variable on
line~\lnref{globalreserve} is at least the sum of all of the
per-thread \co{countermax} variables.

\begin{fcvref}[ln:count:count_lim:utility:globalize]
\Clnrefrange{b}{e} show \co{globalize_count()},
which zeros the current thread's
per-thread counters, adjusting the global variables appropriately.
It is important to note that this function does not change the aggregate
value of the counter, but instead changes how the counter's current value
is represented.
Line~\lnref{add} adds the thread's \co{counter} variable to \co{globalcount},
and line~\lnref{zero} zeroes \co{counter}.
Similarly, line~\lnref{sub} subtracts the per-thread \co{countermax} from
\co{globalreserve}, and line~\lnref{zeromax} zeroes \co{countermax}.
It is helpful to refer to
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Simple Limit Counter Variable Relationships}
when reading both this function and \co{balance_count()}, which is next.

\begin{fcvref}[ln:count:count_lim:utility:balance]
\Clnrefrange{b}{e} show \co{balance_count()},

the inverse of \co{globalize_count()}.
This function's job is to set the current thread's
\co{countermax} variable to the largest value that avoids the risk
of the counter exceeding the \co{globalcountmax} limit.
Changing the current thread's \co{countermax} variable of course
requires corresponding adjustments to \co{counter}, \co{globalcount}
and \co{globalreserve}, as can be seen by referring back to
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Simple Limit Counter Variable Relationships}.
By doing this, \co{balance_count()} maximizes use of
\co{add_count()}'s and \co{sub_count()}'s low-overhead fastpaths.
As with \co{globalize_count()}, \co{balance_count()} is not permitted
to change the aggregate value of the counter.

\Clnrefrange{share:b}{share:e} compute this thread's share of
that portion of
\co{globalcountmax} that is not already covered by either
\co{globalcount} or \co{globalreserve}, and assign the

Line~\lnref{middle} sets this thread's \co{counter} to the middle of the range

It is helpful to look at a schematic depicting how the relationship
of the counters changes with the execution of first
\co{globalize_count()} and then \co{balance_count}, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Schematic of Globalization and Balancing}.
Time advances from left to right, with the leftmost configuration
roughly that of
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Simple Limit Counter Variable Relationships}.
The center configuration shows the relationship of these same counters
after \co{globalize_count()} is executed by thread~0.
As can be seen from the figure, thread~0's \co{counter} (``c~0'' in
the figure) is added to \co{globalcount}, while the value of
\co{globalreserve} is reduced by this same amount.
Both thread~0's \co{counter} and its \co{countermax}
(``cm~0'' in the figure) are reduced to zero.
The other three threads' counters are unchanged.
Note that this change did not affect the overall value of the counter,
as indicated by the bottommost dotted line connecting the leftmost
and center configurations.
In other words, the sum of \co{globalcount} and the four threads'
\co{counter} variables is the same in both configurations.
Similarly, this change did not affect the sum of \co{globalcount} and
\co{globalreserve}, as indicated by the upper dotted line.

The rightmost configuration shows the relationship of these counters
after \co{balance_count()} is executed, again by thread~0.
One-quarter of the remaining count, denoted by the vertical line extending
up from all three configurations, is added to thread~0's
\co{countermax} and half of that to thread~0's \co{counter}.
The amount added to thread~0's \co{counter} is also subtracted from
\co{globalcount} in order to avoid changing the overall value of the
counter (which is again the sum of \co{globalcount} and the three
threads' \co{counter} variables), again as indicated by the lowermost
of the two dotted lines connecting the center and rightmost configurations.
The \co{globalreserve} variable is also adjusted so that this variable
remains equal to the sum of the four threads' \co{countermax}
variables.
Because thread~0's \co{counter} is less than its \co{countermax},
thread~0 can once again increment the counter locally.

\QuickQuiz{
	In Figure~\ref{fig:count:Schematic of Globalization and Balancing},
	even though a quarter of the remaining count up to the limit is
	assigned to thread~0, only an eighth of the remaining count is
	consumed, as indicated by the uppermost dotted line connecting
	the center and the rightmost configurations.
	Why is that?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	The reason this happened is that thread~0's \co{counter} was
	set to half of its \co{countermax}.
	Thus, of the quarter assigned to thread~0, half of that quarter
	(one eighth) came from \co{globalcount}, leaving the other half
	(again, one eighth) to come from the remaining count.

	There are two purposes for taking this approach:
	(1)~To allow thread~0 to use the fastpath for decrements as
	well as increments, and
	(2)~To reduce the inaccuracies if all threads are monotonically
	incrementing up towards the limit.
	To see this last point, step through the algorithm and watch
	what it does.

\subsection{Simple Limit Counter Discussion}
\label{sec:count:Simple Limit Counter Discussion}

This type of counter is quite fast when aggregate values are near zero,
with some overhead due to the comparison and branch in both
\co{add_count()}'s and \co{sub_count()}'s fastpaths.
However, the use of a per-thread \co{countermax} reserve means that
\co{add_count()} can fail even when
the aggregate value of the counter is nowhere near \co{globalcountmax}.
Similarly, \co{sub_count()} can fail
even when the aggregate value of the counter is nowhere near zero.

In many cases, this is unacceptable.
Even if the \co{globalcountmax} is intended to be an approximate limit,
there is usually a limit to exactly how much approximation can be tolerated.
One way to limit the degree of approximation is to impose an upper limit
on the value of the per-thread \co{countermax} instances.
This task is undertaken in the next section.

\subsection{Approximate Limit Counter Implementation}
\label{sec:count:Approximate Limit Counter Implementation}

Because this implementation (\path{count_lim_app.c}) is quite similar to
that in the previous section
(\cref{lst:count:Simple Limit Counter Variables,%
lst:count:Simple Limit Counter Add; Subtract; and Read,%
lst:count:Simple Limit Counter Utility Functions}),
only the changes are shown here.
\Cref{lst:count:Approximate Limit Counter Variables}
is identical to
\cref{lst:count:Simple Limit Counter Variables},
with the addition of \co{MAX_COUNTERMAX}, which sets the maximum
permissible value of the per-thread \co{countermax} variable.

Listing~\ref{lst:count:Simple Limit Counter Utility Functions},
with the addition of
lines~\lnref{enforce:b} and~\lnref{enforce:e}, which enforce the
\co{MAX_COUNTERMAX} limit on the per-thread \co{countermax} variable.
\end{fcvref}

\subsection{Approximate Limit Counter Discussion}

These changes greatly reduce the limit inaccuracy seen in the previous version,
but present another problem: any given value of \co{MAX_COUNTERMAX}
will cause a workload-dependent fraction of accesses to fall off the
fastpath.
As the number of threads increase, non-fastpath execution will become both
a performance and a scalability problem.
However, we will defer this problem and turn instead to counters
with exact limits.

\section{Exact Limit Counters}
\label{sec:count:Exact Limit Counters}
%
\epigraph{Exactitude can be expensive.
	  Spend wisely.}{\emph{Unknown}}

To solve the exact structure-allocation limit problem noted in
\QuickQuizRef{\QcountQexactcnt},
we need a limit counter that can tell exactly when its limits are
exceeded.
One way of implementing such a limit counter is to
cause threads that have reserved counts to give them up.
One way to do this is to use \IX{atomic} instructions.
Of course, atomic instructions will slow down the fastpath, but on the
other hand, it would be silly not to at least give them a try.

\subsection{Atomic Limit Counter Implementation}
\label{sec:count:Atomic Limit Counter Implementation}

Unfortunately,
if one thread is to safely remove counts from another thread,
both threads will need to atomically manipulate that thread's
\co{counter} and \co{countermax} variables.
The usual way to do this is to combine these two variables into a
single variable,
for example, given a 32-bit variable, using the high-order 16 bits to
represent \co{counter} and the low-order 16 bits to represent
\co{countermax}.

\QuickQuiz{
	Why is it necessary to atomically manipulate the thread's
	\co{counter} and \co{countermax} variables as a unit?
	Wouldn't it be good enough to atomically manipulate them
	individually?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	This might well be possible, but great care is required.
	Note that removing \co{counter} without first zeroing
	\co{countermax} could result in the corresponding thread
	increasing \co{counter} immediately after it was zeroed,
	completely negating the effect of zeroing the counter.

	The opposite ordering, namely zeroing \co{countermax} and then
	removing \co{counter}, can also result in a non-zero
	\co{counter}.
	To see this, consider the following sequence of events:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Thread~A fetches its \co{countermax}, and finds that
		it is non-zero.
	\item	Thread~B zeroes Thread~A's \co{countermax}.
	\item	Thread~B removes Thread~A's \co{counter}.
	\item	Thread~A, having found that its \co{countermax}
		is non-zero, proceeds to add to its \co{counter},
		resulting in a non-zero value for \co{counter}.
	\end{enumerate}

	Again, it might well be possible to atomically manipulate
	\co{countermax} and \co{counter} as separate variables,
	but it is clear that great care is required.
	It is also quite likely that doing so will slow down the
	fastpath.

	Exploring these possibilities are left as exercises for
	the reader.

\subsection{Atomic Limit Counter Discussion}

This is the first implementation that actually allows the counter to
be run all the way to either of its limits, but it does so at the
expense of adding atomic operations to the fastpaths, which slow down
the fastpaths significantly on some systems.
Although some workloads might tolerate this slowdown, it is worthwhile
looking for algorithms with better read-side performance.
One such algorithm uses a signal handler to steal counts from other
threads.
Because signal handlers run in the context of the signaled thread,
atomic operations are not necessary, as shown in the next section.

\QuickQuiz{
	But signal handlers can be migrated to some other
	CPU while running.
	Doesn't this possibility require that atomic instructions
	and memory barriers are required to reliably communicate
	between a thread and a signal handler that interrupts that
	thread?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	No.
	If the signal handler is migrated to another CPU, then the
	interrupted thread is also migrated along with it.
}\QuickQuizEnd

\subsection{Signal-Theft Limit Counter Design}
\label{sec:count:Signal-Theft Limit Counter Design}

Even though per-thread state will now be manipulated only by the
corresponding thread, there will still need to be synchronization
with the signal handlers.
This synchronization is provided by the state machine shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Signal-Theft State Machine}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\resizebox{2in}{!}{\includegraphics{count/sig-theft}}
\caption{Signal-Theft State Machine}
\label{fig:count:Signal-Theft State Machine}
\end{figure}

The state machine starts out in the IDLE state, and when \co{add_count()}
or \co{sub_count()} find that the combination of the local thread's count
and the global count cannot accommodate the request, the corresponding
slowpath sets each thread's \co{theft} state to REQ (unless that thread
has no count, in which case it transitions directly to READY).
Only the slowpath, which holds the \co{gblcnt_mutex} lock, is permitted to
transition from the IDLE state, as indicated by the green color.\footnote{
	For those with black-and-white versions of this book,
	IDLE and READY are green, REQ is red, and ACK is blue.}
The slowpath then sends a signal to each thread, and the corresponding
signal handler checks the corresponding thread's \co{theft} and
\co{counting} variables.
If the \co{theft} state is not REQ, then the signal handler is not
permitted to change the state, and therefore simply returns.
Otherwise, if the \co{counting} variable is set, indicating that
the current thread's fastpath is in progress, the signal handler
sets the \co{theft} state to ACK, otherwise to READY\@.

If the \co{theft} state is ACK,
only the fastpath is permitted to change
the \co{theft} state, as indicated by the blue color.
When the fastpath completes, it sets the \co{theft} state to READY\@.

Once the slowpath sees a thread's \co{theft} state is READY, the
slowpath is permitted to steal that thread's count.
The slowpath then sets that thread's \co{theft} state to IDLE\@.

\QuickQuizSeries{%
\QuickQuizB{
	In Figure~\ref{fig:count:Signal-Theft State Machine}, why is
	the REQ \co{theft} state colored red?
}\QuickQuizAnswerB{
	To indicate that only the fastpath is permitted to change the
	\co{theft} state, and that if the thread remains in this
	state for too long, the thread running the slowpath will
	resend the POSIX signal.
}\QuickQuizEndB
%
\QuickQuizE{
	In Figure~\ref{fig:count:Signal-Theft State Machine}, what is
	the point of having separate REQ and ACK \co{theft} states?
	Why not simplify the state machine by collapsing
	them into a single REQACK state?
	Then whichever of the signal handler or the fastpath gets there
	first could set the state to READY\@.
}\QuickQuizAnswerE{
	Reasons why collapsing the REQ and ACK states would be a very
	bad idea include:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	The slowpath uses the REQ and ACK states to determine
		whether the signal should be retransmitted.
		If the states were collapsed, the slowpath would have
		no choice but to send redundant signals, which would
		have the unhelpful effect of needlessly slowing down
		the fastpath.
	\item	The following race would result:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item	The slowpath sets a given thread's state to REQACK.
		\item	That thread has just finished its fastpath, and
			notes the REQACK state.
		\item	The thread receives the signal, which also notes
			the REQACK state, and, because there is no fastpath
			in effect, sets the state to READY\@.
		\item	The slowpath notes the READY state, steals the
			count, and sets the state to IDLE, and completes.
		\item	The fastpath sets the state to READY, disabling
			further fastpath execution for this thread.
		\end{enumerate}
		The basic problem here is that the combined REQACK state
		can be referenced by both the signal handler and the
		fastpath.
		The clear separation maintained by the four-state
		setup ensures orderly state transitions.
	\end{enumerate}
	That said, you might well be able to make a three-state setup
	work correctly.
	If you do succeed, compare carefully to the four-state setup.
	Is the three-state solution really preferable, and why or why not?

The fastpath spans \clnrefrange{fast:b}{return:fs}, and the slowpath
\clnrefrange{acquire}{return:ss}.
Line~\lnref{fast:b} sets the per-thread \co{counting} variable to 1 so that
any subsequent signal handlers interrupting this thread will
set the \co{theft} state to ACK rather than READY, allowing this
fastpath to complete properly.
Line~\lnref{barrier:1} prevents the compiler from reordering any of the fastpath body
to precede the setting of \co{counting}.
Lines~\lnref{check:b} and~\lnref{check:e} check to see
if the per-thread data can accommodate
the \co{add_count()} and if there is no ongoing theft in progress,

line~\lnref{fasttaken} notes that
the fastpath was taken.

In either case, line~\lnref{barrier:2} prevents the compiler from reordering the

Line~\lnref{barrier:3} again disables compiler reordering, and then
line~\lnref{check:ACK}

\subsection{Signal-Theft Limit Counter Discussion}

The signal-theft implementation runs more than eight times as fast as the
atomic implementation on my six-core x86 laptop.
Is it always preferable?

The signal-theft implementation would be vastly preferable on Pentium-4
systems, given their slow atomic instructions, but the old 80386-based
Sequent Symmetry systems would do much better with the shorter path
length of the atomic implementation.
However, this increased update-side performance comes at the
prices of higher read-side overhead: Those POSIX signals are not free.
If ultimate performance is of the essence, you will need to measure
them both on the system that your application is to be deployed on.

\QuickQuiz{
	Not only are POSIX signals slow, sending one to each thread
	simply does not scale.
	What would you do if you had (say) 10,000 threads and needed
	the read side to be fast?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	One approach is to use the techniques shown in
	Section~\ref{sec:count:Eventually Consistent Implementation},
	summarizing an approximation to the overall counter value in
	a single variable.
	Another approach would be to use multiple threads to carry
	out the reads, with each such thread interacting with a
	specific subset of the updating threads.
}\QuickQuizEnd

This is but one reason why high-quality APIs are so important:
they permit implementations to be changed as required by ever-changing
hardware performance characteristics.

\QuickQuiz{
	What if you want an exact limit counter to be exact only for
	its lower limit, but to allow the upper limit to be inexact?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	One simple solution is to overstate the upper limit by the
	desired amount.
	The limiting case of such overstatement results in the
	upper limit being set to the largest value that the counter is
	capable of representing.
}\QuickQuizEnd

\subsection{Applying Exact Limit Counters}
\label{sec:count:Applying Exact Limit Counters}

Although the exact limit counter implementations presented in this
section can be very useful, they are not much help if the counter's value
remains near zero at all times, as it might when counting the number
of outstanding accesses to an I/O device.
The high overhead of such near-zero counting is especially painful
given that we normally don't care how many references there are.
As noted in the removable I/O device access-count problem posed by
\QuickQuizRef{\QcountQIOcnt},
the number of accesses is irrelevant except in those rare cases when
someone is actually trying to remove the device.

One simple solution to this problem is to add a large ``bias''
(for example, one billion) to the
counter in order to ensure that the value is far enough from zero that
the counter can operate efficiently.
When someone wants to remove the device, this bias is subtracted from
the counter value.
Counting the last few accesses will be quite inefficient,
but the important point is that the many prior accesses will have been
counted at full speed.

\QuickQuiz{
	What else had you better have done when using a biased counter?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	You had better have set the upper limit to be large enough
	accommodate the bias, the expected maximum number of accesses,
	and enough ``slop'' to allow the counter to work efficiently
	even when the number of accesses is at its maximum.
}\QuickQuizEnd

Although a biased counter can be quite helpful and useful, it is only a
partial solution to the removable I/O device access-count problem
called out on
page~\pageref{chp:Counting}.
When attempting to remove a device, we must not only know the precise
number of current I/O accesses, we also need to prevent any future
accesses from starting.
One way to accomplish this is to read-acquire a reader-writer lock
when updating the counter, and to write-acquire that same reader-writer
lock when checking the counter.
Code for doing I/O might be as follows:

\begin{fcvlabel}[ln:count:inline:I/O]
\begin{VerbatimN}[commandchars=\\\[\]]
read_lock(&mylock);		\lnlbl[acq]
if (removing) {			\lnlbl[check]
	read_unlock(&mylock);	\lnlbl[rel1]
	cancel_io();		\lnlbl[cancel]
} else {
	add_count(1);		\lnlbl[inc]
	read_unlock(&mylock);	\lnlbl[rel2]
	do_io();		\lnlbl[do]
	sub_count(1);		\lnlbl[dec]
}
\end{VerbatimN}
\end{fcvlabel}

\begin{fcvref}[ln:count:inline:I/O]
Line~\lnref{acq} read-acquires the lock, and either
line~\lnref{rel1} or~\lnref{rel2} releases it.
Line~\lnref{check} checks to see if the device is being removed, and, if so,
line~\lnref{rel1} releases the lock and
line~\lnref{cancel} cancels the I/O, or takes whatever
action is appropriate given that the device is to be removed.
Otherwise, line~\lnref{inc} increments the access count,
line~\lnref{rel2} releases the
lock, line~\lnref{do} performs the I/O, and
line~\lnref{dec} decrements the access count.
\end{fcvref}

\QuickQuiz{
	This is ridiculous!
	We are \emph{read}-acquiring a reader-writer lock to
	\emph{update} the counter?
	What are you playing at???
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Strange, perhaps, but true!
	Almost enough to make you think that the name
	``reader-writer lock'' was poorly chosen, isn't it?
}\QuickQuizEnd

The code to remove the device might be as follows:

\begin{fcvlabel}[ln:count:inline:remove]
\begin{VerbatimN}[commandchars=\\\[\]]
write_lock(&mylock);		\lnlbl[acq]
removing = 1;			\lnlbl[note]
sub_count(mybias);
write_unlock(&mylock);		\lnlbl[rel]
while (read_count() != 0) {	\lnlbl[loop:b]
	poll(NULL, 0, 1);
}				\lnlbl[loop:e]
remove_device();		\lnlbl[remove]
\end{VerbatimN}
\end{fcvlabel}

\begin{fcvref}[ln:count:inline:remove]
Line~\lnref{acq} write-acquires the lock and
line~\lnref{rel} releases it.
Line~\lnref{note} notes that the device is being removed, and the loop spanning
\clnrefrange{loop:b}{loop:e} waits for any I/O operations to complete.
Finally, line~\lnref{remove} does any additional processing needed to prepare for
device removal.
\end{fcvref}

\QuickQuiz{
	What other issues would need to be accounted for in a real system?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	A huge number!

	Here are a few to start with:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	There could be any number of devices, so that the
		global variables are inappropriate, as are the
		lack of arguments to functions like \co{do_io()}.
	\item	Polling loops can be problematic in real systems,
		wasting CPU time and energy.
		In many cases, an event-driven design is far better,
		for example, where the last completing I/O wakes up the
		device-removal thread.
	\item	The I/O might fail, and so \co{do_io()} will likely
		need a return value.
	\item	If the device fails, the last I/O might never complete.
		In such cases, there might need to be some sort of
		timeout to allow error recovery.
	\item	Both \co{add_count()} and \co{sub_count()} can
		fail, but their return values are not checked.
	\item	Reader-writer locks do not scale well.
		One way of avoiding the high read-acquisition costs
		of reader-writer locks is presented in
		\cref{chp:Locking,chp:Deferred Processing}.

\section{Parallel Counting Discussion}
\label{sec:count:Parallel Counting Discussion}
%
\epigraph{This idea that there is generality in the specific is of
	  far-reaching importance.}
	 {\emph{Douglas R. Hofstadter}}

This chapter has presented the reliability, performance, and
scalability problems with traditional counting primitives.
The C-language \co{++} operator is not guaranteed to function reliably in
multithreaded code, and atomic operations to a single variable neither
perform nor scale well.
This chapter therefore presented a number of counting algorithms that
perform and scale extremely well in certain special cases.

It is well worth reviewing the lessons from these counting algorithms.
To that end,
Section~\ref{sec:count:Parallel Counting Performance}
summarizes performance and scalability,
Section~\ref{sec:count:Parallel Counting Specializations}
discusses the need for specialization,
and finally,
Section~\ref{sec:count:Parallel Counting Lessons}
enumerates lessons learned and calls attention to later chapters that
will expand on these lessons.

\subsection{Parallel Counting Performance}
\label{sec:count:Parallel Counting Performance}

The top half of \cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86}
shows the performance of the four parallel statistical counting
algorithms.
All four algorithms provide near-perfect linear scalability for updates.
The per-thread-variable implementation (\path{count_end.c})
is significantly faster on
updates than the array-based implementation
(\path{count_stat.c}), but is slower at reads on large numbers of core,
and suffers severe \IX{lock contention} when there are many parallel readers.
This contention can be addressed using the deferred-processing
techniques introduced in
Chapter~\ref{chp:Deferred Processing},
as shown on the \path{count_end_rcu.c} row of
\cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86}.
Deferred processing also shines on the \path{count_stat_eventual.c} row,
courtesy of eventual consistency.

\QuickQuizSeries{%
\QuickQuizB{
	On the \path{count_stat.c} row of
	\cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86},
	we see that the read-side scales linearly with the number of
	threads.
	How is that possible given that the more threads there are,
	the more per-thread counters must be summed up?
}\QuickQuizAnswerB{
	The read-side code must scan the entire fixed-size array, regardless
	of the number of threads, so there is no difference in performance.
	In contrast, in the last two algorithms, readers must do more
	work when there are more threads.
	In addition, the last two algorithms interpose an additional
	level of indirection because they map from integer thread ID
	to the corresponding \co{__thread} variable.
}\QuickQuizEndB
%
\QuickQuizE{
	Even on the fourth row of
	\cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86},
	the read-side performance of these statistical counter
	implementations is pretty horrible.
	So why bother with them?
}\QuickQuizAnswerE{
	``Use the right tool for the job.''

	As can be seen from
	Figure~\ref{fig:count:Atomic Increment Scalability on x86},
	single-variable atomic increment need not apply for any job
	involving heavy use of parallel updates.
	In contrast, the algorithms shown in the top half of
	\cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86}
	do an excellent job of handling update-heavy situations.
	Of course, if you have a read-mostly situation, you should
	use something else, for example, an eventually consistent design
	featuring a single atomically incremented
	variable that can be read out using a single load,
	similar to the approach used in
	Section~\ref{sec:count:Eventually Consistent Implementation}.
}\QuickQuizEndE
}

The bottom half of \cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86}
shows the performance of the parallel limit-counting algorithms.
Exact enforcement of the limits incurs a substantial update-side
performance penalty, although on this x86 system that penalty can be
reduced by substituting signals for atomic operations.
All of these implementations suffer from read-side lock contention
in the face of concurrent readers.

\QuickQuizSeries{%
\QuickQuizB{
	Given the performance data shown in the bottom half of
	\cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86},
	we should always prefer signals over atomic operations, right?
}\QuickQuizAnswerB{
	That depends on the workload.
	Note that on a 64-core system, you need more than
	one hundred non-atomic operations (with roughly
	a 40-nanosecond performance gain) to make up for even one
	signal (with almost a 5-\emph{microsecond} performance loss).
	Although there are no shortage of workloads with far greater
	read intensity, you will need to consider your particular
	workload.

	In addition, although memory barriers have historically been
	expensive compared to ordinary instructions, you should
	check this on the specific hardware you will be running.
	The properties of computer hardware do change over time,
	and algorithms must change accordingly.
}\QuickQuizEndB
%
\QuickQuizE{
	Can advanced techniques be applied to address the lock
	contention for readers seen in the bottom half of
	\cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86}?
}\QuickQuizAnswerE{
	One approach is to give up some update-side performance, as is
	done with scalable non-zero indicators
	(SNZI)~\cite{FaithEllen:2007:SNZI}.
	There are a number of other ways one might go about this, and these
	are left as exercises for the reader.
	Any number of approaches that apply hierarchy, which replace
	frequent global-lock acquisitions with local lock acquisitions
	corresponding to lower levels of the hierarchy, should work quite well.
}\QuickQuizEndE
}

In short, this chapter has demonstrated a number of counting algorithms
that perform and scale extremely well in a number of special cases.
But must our parallel counting be confined to special cases?
Wouldn't it be better to have a general algorithm that operated
efficiently in all cases?
The next section looks at these questions.

\subsection{Parallel Counting Specializations}
\label{sec:count:Parallel Counting Specializations}

The fact that these algorithms only work well in their respective special
cases might be considered a major problem with parallel programming in
general.
After all, the C-language \co{++} operator works just fine in single-threaded
code, and not just for special cases, but in general, right?

This line of reasoning does contain a grain of truth, but is in essence
misguided.
The problem is not parallelism as such, but rather scalability.
To understand this, first consider the C-language \co{++} operator.
The fact is that it does \emph{not} work in general, only for a restricted
range of numbers.
If you need to deal with 1,000-digit decimal numbers, the C-language \co{++}
operator will not work for you.

\QuickQuiz{
	The \co{++} operator works just fine for 1,000-digit numbers!
	Haven't you heard of operator overloading???
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	In the C++ language, you might well be able to use \co{++}
	on a 1,000-digit number, assuming that you had access to a
	class implementing such numbers.
	But as of 2021, the C language does not permit operator overloading.
}\QuickQuizEnd

This problem is not specific to arithmetic.
Suppose you need to store and query data.
Should you use an ASCII file?
XML?
A relational database?
A linked list?
A dense array?
A B-tree?
A radix tree?
Or one of the plethora of other data
structures and environments that permit data to be stored and queried?
It depends on what you need to do, how fast you need it done, and how
large your data set is---even on sequential systems.

Similarly, if you need to count, your solution will depend on how large
of numbers you need to work with, how many CPUs need to be manipulating
a given number concurrently, how the number is to be used, and what
level of performance and scalability you will need.

Nor is this problem specific to software.
The design for a bridge meant to allow people to walk across a small brook
might be a simple as a single wooden plank.
But you would probably not use a plank to span the kilometers-wide mouth of
the Columbia River, nor would such a design be advisable for bridges
carrying concrete trucks.
In short, just as bridge design must change with increasing span and load,
so must software design change as the number of CPUs increases.
That said, it would be good to automate this process, so that the
software adapts to changes in hardware configuration and in workload.
There has in fact been some research into this sort of
automation~\cite{Appavoo03a,Soules03a}, and the Linux kernel does some
boot-time reconfiguration, including limited binary rewriting.
This sort of adaptation will become increasingly important as the
number of CPUs on mainstream systems continues to increase.

In short, as discussed in
Chapter~\ref{chp:Hardware and its Habits},
the laws of physics constrain parallel software just as surely as they
constrain mechanical artifacts such as bridges.
These constraints force specialization, though in the case of software
it might be possible to automate the choice of specialization to
fit the hardware and workload in question.

Of course, even generalized counting is quite specialized.
We need to do a great number of other things with computers.
The next section relates what we have learned from counters to
topics taken up later in this book.

\subsection{Parallel Counting Lessons}
\label{sec:count:Parallel Counting Lessons}

The opening paragraph of this chapter promised that our study of counting
would provide an excellent introduction to parallel programming.
This section makes explicit connections between the lessons from
this chapter and the material presented in a number of later chapters.

The examples in this chapter have shown that an important scalability
and performance tool is \emph{partitioning}.
The counters might be fully partitioned, as in the statistical counters
discussed in \cref{sec:count:Statistical Counters},
or partially partitioned as in the limit counters discussed in
\cref{sec:count:Approximate Limit Counters,%
sec:count:Exact Limit Counters}.
Partitioning will be considered in far greater depth in
\cref{cha:Partitioning and Synchronization Design},
and partial parallelization in particular in
\cref{sec:SMPdesign:Parallel Fastpath}, where it is called
\emph{parallel fastpath}.

\QuickQuiz{
	But if we are going to have to partition everything, why bother
	with shared-memory multithreading?
	Why not just partition the problem completely and run as
	multiple processes, each in its own address space?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Indeed, multiple processes with separate address spaces can be
	an excellent way to exploit parallelism, as the proponents of
	the fork-join methodology and the Erlang language would be very
	quick to tell you.
	However, there are also some advantages to shared-memory parallelism:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Only the most performance-critical portions of the
		application must be partitioned, and such portions
		are usually a small fraction of the application.
	\item	Although cache misses are quite slow compared to
		individual register-to-register instructions,
		they are typically considerably faster than
		inter-process-communication primitives, which in
		turn are considerably faster than things like
		TCP/IP networking.
	\item	Shared-memory multiprocessors are readily available
		and quite inexpensive, so, in stark contrast to the
		1990s, there is little cost penalty for use of
		shared-memory parallelism.
	\end{enumerate}
	As always, use the right tool for the job!
}\QuickQuizEnd

The partially partitioned counting algorithms used locking to
guard the global data, and locking is the subject of
Chapter~\ref{chp:Locking}.
In contrast, the partitioned data tended to be fully under the control of
the corresponding thread, so that no synchronization whatsoever was required.
This \emph{data ownership} will be introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:SMPdesign:Data Ownership}
and discussed in more detail in
Chapter~\ref{chp:Data Ownership}.

Because integer addition and subtraction are extremely cheap
compared to typical synchronization operations, achieving reasonable
scalability requires synchronization operations be used sparingly.
One way of achieving this is to batch the addition and subtraction
operations, so that a great many of these cheap operations are handled
by a single synchronization operation.
Batching optimizations of one sort or another are used by each of
the counting algorithms listed in
\cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86}.

Finally, the eventually consistent statistical counter discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:count:Eventually Consistent Implementation}
showed how deferring activity (in that case, updating the global
counter) can provide substantial performance and scalability benefits.
This approach allows common case code to use much cheaper synchronization
operations than would otherwise be possible.
Chapter~\ref{chp:Deferred Processing} will examine a number of additional
ways that deferral can improve performance, scalability, and even
real-time response.

Summarizing the summary:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Partitioning promotes performance and scalability.
\item	Partial partitioning, that is, partitioning applied only to
	common code paths, works almost as well.
\item	Partial partitioning can be applied to code (as in
	Section~\ref{sec:count:Statistical Counters}'s statistical
	counters' partitioned updates and non-partitioned reads), but also
	across time (as in
	Section~\ref{sec:count:Approximate Limit Counters}'s and
	Section~\ref{sec:count:Exact Limit Counters}'s
	limit counters running fast when far from
	the limit, but slowly when close to the limit).
\item	Partitioning across time often batches updates locally
	in order to reduce the number of expensive global operations,
	thereby decreasing synchronization overhead, in turn
	improving performance and scalability.
	All the algorithms shown in
	\cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86}
	make heavy use of batching.
\item	Read-only code paths should remain read-only:  Spurious
	synchronization writes to shared memory kill performance
	and scalability, as seen in the \path{count_end.c} row of
	\cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86}.
\item	Judicious use of delay promotes performance and scalability, as
	seen in Section~\ref{sec:count:Eventually Consistent Implementation}.
\item	Parallel performance and scalability is usually a balancing act:
	Beyond a certain point, optimizing some code paths will degrade
	others.
	The \path{count_stat.c} and \path{count_end_rcu.c} rows of
	\cref{tab:count:Statistical/Limit Counter Performance on x86}
	illustrate this point.
\item	Different levels of performance and scalability will affect
	algorithm and data-structure design, as do a large number of
	other factors.
	\Cref{fig:count:Atomic Increment Scalability on x86}
	illustrates this point:  Atomic increment might be completely
	acceptable for a two-CPU system, but be completely inadequate for an
	eight-CPU system.

Summarizing still further, we have the ``big three'' methods of
increasing performance and scalability, namely
(1)~\emph{partitioning} over CPUs or threads,
(2)~\emph{batching} so that more work can be done by each expensive
synchronization operations, and
(3)~\emph{weakening} synchronization operations where feasible.
As a rough rule of thumb, you should apply these methods in this order,
as was noted earlier in the discussion of
Figure~\ref{fig:intro:Ordering of Parallel-Programming Tasks}
on
page~\pageref{fig:intro:Ordering of Parallel-Programming Tasks}.
The partitioning optimization applies to the
``Resource Partitioning and Replication'' bubble,
the batching optimization to the ``Work Partitioning'' bubble,
and the weakening optimization to the ``Parallel Access Control'' bubble,
as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:count:Optimization and the Four Parallel-Programming Tasks}.
Of course, if you are using special-purpose hardware such as
digital signal processors (DSPs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs),
or general-purpose graphical processing units (GPGPUs), you may need
to pay close attention to the ``Interacting With Hardware'' bubble
throughout the design process.
For example, the structure of a GPGPU's hardware threads and memory
connectivity might richly reward very careful partitioning
and batching design decisions.

In short, as noted at the beginning of this chapter, the simplicity
of counting have allowed us to explore many
fundamental concurrency issues without the distraction of
complex synchronization primitives or elaborate data structures.
Such synchronization primitives and data structures are covered
in later chapters.

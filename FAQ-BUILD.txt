1.	I have installed the Steel City Comic font referring to item 1
	in FAQ.txt, and rebuilt "perfbook.pdf". But it doesn't seem to
	have any effect. What am I missing?

	A.	If you built "perfbook.pdf" before installing the font,
		you need to rebuild cartoons whose sources are .svg
		files.  Typing "make touchsvg; make" will do the trick.

2.	I prefer perfbook-1c.pdf than perfbook.pdf to read it on my
	tablet. Typing "make perfbook-1c.pdf" every time is a little
	bit cumbersome. Isn't there any simpler way?

	A.	Actually there is!  Just type "make 1c".

3.	Are there other short name targets?

	A.	"make hb" will build perfbook-hb.pdf that is useful
		for making hard-bound printouts.
		"make 2c" will build perfbook.pdf.
		"make help" will show you the full list of targets.

4.	Isn't it possible to build perfbook-1c.pdf by just typing
	"make"?

	A.	Yes, it is!  Define an environment variable
		"PERFBOOK_DEFAULT" in your shell and set its value as
		"1c".  Then, just typing "make" will build
		perfbook-1c.pdf.
		If you set "hb" to "PERFBOOK_DEFAULT", typing "make"
		will build perfbook-hb.pdf mentioned in #3.
		While you have the environment variable set, specifying
		a specific target (or targets) always works.

5.	The Makefile cannot find pdflatex.  What is it and where can I
	find it?

	A.	The "pdflatex" package is a variant of Don Knuth's
		digital typesetting program.  On Ubuntu Xenial,
		installing the following set of packages suffices:

			texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra psutils
			texlive-publishers-doc texlive-fonts-extra
			texlive-math-extra texlive-publishers
			texlive-science texlive-bibtex-extra
			gnuplot-x11 xfig inkscape graphviz fig2ps

		On Ubuntu Bionic, the following list should cover
		necessary packages (except for -doc packages):
			texlive-publishers texlive-pstricks
			texlive-science texlive-fonts-extra
			xfig inkscape graphviz fig2ps

		You need to fetch a version of a2ping which is
		compatible with updated Ghostscript (not limited to
		Ubuntu Bionic). See #7 below.

		Ubuntu Bionic has a buggy version of a LaTeX package
		"cleveref".  See #10 below to install latest one.

		On Fedora 30 and 29, installing the following set of
		packages suffices:
			texlive-collection-plaingeneric
			texlive-collection-binextra
			texlive-collection-latexextra
			texlive-collection-fontsextra
			fig2ps graphviz inkscape

		On other Linux distributions such as RHEL/CentOS and
		Scientific Linux, where support of TeX Live packages
		is insufficient, manually installing TeX Live should
		be a reasonable choice.
		See: https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html

		NOTE: In doing so, you might end up in having
			redundant texlive packages of your choise
			of distribution to satisfy dependency
			of other packages.

		Besides TeX Live, you need the following list of
		packages:
			fig2ps graphviz inkscape

6.	I cannot build perfbook, and the perfbook.log file complains
	about some obscure package being missing.  What do I do?

	A.	Please see #5 above.

7.	Building perfbook aborts with error "You need to update a2ping".
	What can I do?

	A.	a2ping 2.77p has become incompatible with up-to-date
		Ghostscript on most Linux distributions since September
		2018 due to security fixes backported from Ghostscript
		9.22 and later. A compatible a2ping (2.83p) is available
		at:
			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/a2ping

		Copy "a2ping.pl" as "a2ping" into a directory which
		precedes /usr/bin in your PATH setting.

		a2ping 2.83p is included in TeX Live 2018 or later.

8.	When I try to build perfbook, it hangs after printing a line
	reading "pdflatex 1".  How can I fix this?

	A.	On UNIX-like systems, including Linux, type control-D.
		Then look at the end of the perfbook.log file (or the
		perfbook-1c.log file if you were building single-column).
		The error message at the end of the log file should
		indicate the source of the problem.

		The build scripts are supposed to make this unnecessary,
		so if it happens, please let me know.  Please send me the
		perfbook.log output (or perfbook-1c.log output, depending
		on which you were building) so that I can fix the scripts.

9.	Some of experimental targets for alternative font won't build
	due to lack of necessary packages such as "newtxtt". How can I
	install those packages?

	A.	The simplest approach is to upgrade to a recent TeX
		distribution such as TeX Live 2018.  Upgrading your Linux
		distribution (e.g. to Ubuntu Bionic) is one way to
		upgrade TeX Live (to 2017 on Bionic), and might	have many
		other benefits as well.

		However, if you prefer to manually install individual
		packages, refer to "Method 3" in:

			http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/73016/

		For font packages such as "newtxtt" and "nimbus15",
		you must also update font-map database. See:

			http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/88423/

		Note: If available, you can use the <package>.tds.zip,
		which will automatically put the files in a relatively
		right place. Note that font packages should be copied to
		the TEXMFLOCAL directory rather than to the TEXMFHOME
		directory.

		Following is a list of links to optional packages as of
		October 2017:

			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtxtt
			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/nimbus15
			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/inconsolata
			https://www.ctan.org/pkg/newtxsf

10.	Building perfbook finished with a waring of buggy cleveref.
	How can I update the package?

	A.	This is a known issue on Ubuntu Bionic. So this answer
		assumes Ubuntu Bionic.

	    1.	Download cleveref.zip from CTAN mirror:
		http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/cleveref.zip

	    2.	Install it by following instructions at:
		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LaTeX#Installing_packages_manually

11.	Running "make" generates perfbook.synctex.gz. What is it for?

	A.	It enables SyncTeX-search mechanism supported by
		some combinations of text editors and PDF viewers.
		It helps you find out which .tex file is related to
		a particlar line/page in PDF --- and vice versa.

	    Notes:
	      -	For an introduction of SyncTeX (gedit <-> evince), see:

		    https://help.gnome.org/users/evince/stable/index.html.en#synctex

	      - You need to open one of LaTeX sources (e.g. perfbook.tex)
		in gedit first.

	      - SyncTeX search works only for perfbook.pdf due to the
		embedded pointers at the top of included .tex files.
		The other .pdf targets don't generate .synctex.gz

	      -	Appendix "Answers to Quick Quizzes" is not covered.

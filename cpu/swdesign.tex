The values of the ratios in
\cref{tab:cpu:CPU 0 View of Synchronization Mechanisms on 8-Socket System With Intel Xeon Platinum 8176 CPUs at 2.10GHz}
are critically important, as they limit the
efficiency of a given parallel application.
To see this, suppose that the parallel application uses \IXacr{cas}
operations to communicate among threads.
These CAS operations will typically involve a cache miss, that is, assuming
that the threads are communicating primarily with each other rather than
with themselves.
Suppose further that the unit of work corresponding to each CAS communication
operation takes 300\,ns, which is sufficient time to compute several
floating-point transcendental functions.
Then about half of the execution time will be consumed by the CAS
communication operations!
This in turn means that a two-CPU system running such a parallel program
would run no faster than a sequential implementation running on a
single CPU\@.

The situation is even worse in the distributed-system case, where the
latency of a single communications operation might take as long as
thousands or even millions of floating-point operations.
This illustrates how important it is for communications operations to
be extremely infrequent and to enable very large quantities of processing.

\QuickQuiz{
	Given that distributed-systems communication is so horribly
	expensive, why does anyone bother with such systems?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	There are a number of reasons:

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Shared-memory multiprocessor systems have strict size limits.
		If you need more than a few thousand CPUs, you have no
		choice but to use a distributed system.
	\item	Large shared-memory systems tend to be more expensive
		per unit computation than their smaller counterparts.
	\item	Large shared-memory systems tend to have much longer
		cache-miss latencies than do smaller system.
		To see this, compare
		\cref{tab:cpu:CPU 0 View of Synchronization Mechanisms on 8-Socket System With Intel Xeon Platinum 8176 CPUs at 2.10GHz}
		on \cpageref{tab:cpu:CPU 0 View of Synchronization Mechanisms on 8-Socket System With Intel Xeon Platinum 8176 CPUs at 2.10GHz}
		with
		\cref{tab:cpu:CPU 0 View of Synchronization Mechanisms on 12-CPU Intel Core i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz}.
	\item	The distributed-systems communications operations do
		not necessarily use much CPU, so that computation can
		proceed in parallel with message transfer.
	\item	Many important problems are ``embarrassingly parallel'',
		so that extremely large quantities of processing may
		be enabled by a very small number of messages.
		SETI@HOME~\cite{SETIatHOME2008}
		was but one example of such an application.
		These sorts of applications can make good use of networks
		of computers despite extremely long communications
		latencies.
	\end{enumerate}

	Thus, large shared-memory systems tend to be used for applications
	that benefit from faster latencies than can be provided by
	distributed computing, and particularly for those applications
	that benefit from a large shared memory.

	It is likely that continued work on parallel applications will
	increase the number of embarrassingly parallel applications that
	can run well on machines and/or clusters having long communications
	latencies, reductions in cost being the driving force that it is.
	That said, greatly reduced hardware latencies would be an
	extremely welcome development, both for single-system and
	for distributed computing.

The lesson should be quite clear:
Parallel algorithms must be explicitly designed with these hardware
properties firmly in mind.
One approach is to run nearly independent threads.
The less frequently the threads communicate, whether by \IX{atomic} operations,
locks, or explicit messages, the better the application's performance
and scalability will be.
This approach will be touched on in \cref{chp:Counting},
explored in \cref{cha:Partitioning and Synchronization Design},
and taken to its logical extreme in \cref{chp:Data Ownership}.

Another approach is to make sure that any sharing be read-mostly, which
allows the CPUs' caches to replicate the read-mostly data, in turn
allowing all CPUs fast access.
This approach is touched on in
\cref{sec:count:Eventually Consistent Implementation},
and explored more deeply in \cref{chp:Deferred Processing}.

In short, achieving excellent parallel performance and scalability means
striving for embarrassingly parallel algorithms and implementations,
whether by careful choice of data structures and algorithms, use of
existing parallel applications and environments, or transforming the
problem into an embarrassingly parallel form.

\QuickQuiz{
	OK, if we are going to have to apply distributed-programming
	techniques to shared-memory parallel programs, why not just
	always use these distributed techniques and dispense with
	shared memory?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Because it is often the case that only a small fraction of
	the program is performance-critical.
	Shared-memory parallelism allows us to focus distributed-programming
	techniques on that small fraction, allowing simpler shared-memory
	techniques to be used on the non-performance-critical bulk of
	the program.

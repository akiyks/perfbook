\epigraph{The devil is in the details.}{Unknown}

The data structures shown in this book were coded straightforwardly,
with no adaptation to the underlying system's cache hierarchy.
In addition, many of the implementations used pointers to functions
for key-to-hash conversions and other frequent operations.
Although this approach provides simplicity and portability, in many
cases it does give up some performance.

The following sections touch on specialization, memory conservation,
and hardware considerations.
Please do not mistake these short sections for a definitive treatise
on this subject.
Whole books have been written on optimizing for a specific CPU, let
alone to the wide variety of CPU families in common use today.

\subsection{Specialization}
\label{sec:together:Specialization}

The resizable hash table presented in
\cref{sec:datastruct:Non-Partitionable Data Structures}
on
\cpageref{sec:datastruct:Non-Partitionable Data Structures}
used an opaque type for the key.
This allows great flexibility, permitting any sort of key to be
used, but it also incurs significant overhead due to the calls via
of pointers to functions.
Now, modern hardware uses sophisticated branch-prediction techniques
to minimize this overhead, but on the other hand, real-world software
is often larger than can be accommodated even by today's large
hardware branch-prediction tables.
This is especially the case for calls via pointers, in which case
the branch prediction hardware must record a pointer in addition
to branch-taken/branch-not-taken information.

This overhead can be eliminated by specializing a hash-table implementation
to a given key type and hash function, for example, by using C++ templates.
Doing so eliminates the \co{->ht_cmp()}, \co{->ht_gethash()}, and
\co{->ht_getkey()} function pointers in the \co{ht} structure shown in
\cref{lst:datastruct:Resizable Hash-Table Data Structures} on
\cpageref{lst:datastruct:Resizable Hash-Table Data Structures}.
It also eliminates the corresponding calls through these pointers,
which could allow the compiler to inline the resulting fixed functions,
eliminating not only the overhead of the call instruction, but the
argument marshalling as well.

\QuickQuiz{
	How much do these specializations really save?
	Are they really worth it?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	The answer to the first question is left as an exercise to
	the reader.
	Try specializing the resizable hash table and see how much
	performance improvement results.
	The second question cannot be answered in general, but must
	instead be answered with respect to a specific use case.
	Some use cases are extremely sensitive to performance and
	scalability, while others are less so.
}\QuickQuizEnd

All that aside, one of the great benefits of modern hardware compared
to that available when I first started learning to program back in
the early 1970s is that much less specialization is required.
This allows much greater productivity than was possible back in the
days of four-kilobyte address spaces.

\subsection{Bits and Bytes}
\label{sec:together:Bits and Bytes}

The hash tables discussed in this chapter made almost no attempt to conserve
memory.
For example, the \co{->ht_idx} field in the \co{ht} structure in
\cref{lst:datastruct:Resizable Hash-Table Data Structures} on
\cpageref{lst:datastruct:Resizable Hash-Table Data Structures}
always has a value of either zero or one, yet takes up a full 32 bits
of memory.
It could be eliminated, for example, by stealing a bit from the
\co{->ht_resize_key} field.
This works because the \co{->ht_resize_key} field is large enough to
address every byte of memory and the \co{ht_bucket} structure
is more than one byte long, so that
the \co{->ht_resize_key} field must have several bits to spare.

This sort of bit-packing trick is frequently used in data structures
that are highly replicated, as is the \co{page} structure in the Linux
kernel.
However, the resizable hash table's \co{ht} structure is not all that
highly replicated.
It is instead the \co{ht_bucket} structures we should focus on.
There are two major opportunities for shrinking the \co{ht_bucket} structure:
\begin{enumerate*}[(1)]
\item Placing the \tco{->htb_lock} field in a low-order bit of one of the
\tco{->htb_head} pointers and
\item Reducing the number of pointers required.
\end{enumerate*}

The first opportunity might make use of bit-spinlocks in the Linux
kernel, which are provided by the \path{include/linux/bit_spinlock.h}
header file.
These are used in space-critical data structures in the Linux kernel,
but are not without their disadvantages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	They are significantly slower than the traditional spinlock
	primitives.
\item	They cannot participate in the lockdep deadlock detection
	tooling in the Linux kernel~\cite{JonathanCorbet2006lockdep}.
\item	They do not record lock ownership, further complicating
	debugging.
\item	They do not participate in priority boosting in \rt\ kernels,
	which means that preemption must be disabled when holding
	bit spinlocks, which can degrade real-time latency.
\end{enumerate}

Despite these disadvantages, bit-spinlocks are extremely useful when
memory is at a premium.

One aspect of the second opportunity was covered in
\cref{sec:datastruct:Other Resizable Hash Tables}
on
\cpageref{sec:datastruct:Other Resizable Hash Tables},
which presented resizable hash tables that require only one
set of bucket-list pointers in place of the pair of sets required
by the resizable hash table presented in
\cref{sec:datastruct:Non-Partitionable Data Structures}
on
\cpageref{sec:datastruct:Non-Partitionable Data Structures}.
Another approach would be to use singly linked bucket lists in
place of the doubly linked lists used in this chapter.
One downside of this approach is that deletion would then require
additional overhead, either by marking the outgoing pointer
for later removal
or by searching the bucket list for the element being deleted.

In short, there is a tradeoff between minimal memory overhead on
the one hand, and performance and simplicity on the other.
Fortunately, the relatively large memories available on modern
systems have allowed us to prioritize performance and simplicity
over memory overhead.
However, even though the year~2022's pocket-sized smartphones sport
many gigabytes of memory and its mid-range servers sport terabytes, it
is sometimes necessary to take extreme measures to reduce memory overhead.

\subsection{Hardware Considerations}
\label{sec:together:Hardware Considerations}

Modern computers typically move data between CPUs and main memory in
fixed-sized blocks that range in size from 32 bytes to 256 bytes.
These blocks are called \emph{\IX{cache line}s}, and are extremely important
to high performance and scalability, as was discussed in
\cref{sec:cpu:Overheads}.
One timeworn way to kill both performance and scalability is to
place incompatible variables into the same cacheline.
For example, suppose that a resizable hash table data element had
the \co{ht_elem} structure in the same cacheline as a frequently incremented
counter.
The frequent incrementing would cause the cacheline to be present at
the CPU doing the incrementing, but nowhere else.
If other CPUs attempted to traverse the hash bucket list containing
that element, they would incur expensive cache misses, degrading both
performance and scalability.

\begin{listing}
\begin{VerbatimL}
struct hash_elem {
	struct ht_elem e;
	long __attribute__ ((aligned(64))) counter;
};
\end{VerbatimL}
\caption{Alignment for 64-Byte Cache Lines}
\label{lst:together:Alignment for 64-Byte Cache Lines}
\end{listing}

One way to solve this problem on systems with 64-byte cache line is shown in
\cref{lst:together:Alignment for 64-Byte Cache Lines}.
Here \GCC's \co{aligned} attribute is used to force the \co{->counter}
and the \co{ht_elem} structure into separate cache lines.
This would allow CPUs to traverse the hash bucket list at full speed
despite the frequent incrementing.

Of course, this raises the question ``How did we know that cache lines
are 64 bytes in size?''
On a Linux system, this information may be obtained from the
\path{/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cache/} directories, and it is even
possible to make the installation process rebuild the application to
accommodate the system's hardware structure.
However, this would be more difficult if you wanted your application to
also run on a variety of environments, including non-Linux systems.
Furthermore, even if you were content to run only on Linux, such a
self-modifying installation poses validation challenges.
For example, systems with 32-byte cachelines might work well, but
performance might suffer on systems with 64-byte cachelines due
to \IX{false sharing}.

Fortunately, there are some rules of thumb that work reasonably well in
practice, which were gathered into a 1995
paper~\cite{BenjaminGamsa95a}.\footnote{
	A number of these rules are paraphrased and expanded on here
	with permission from Orran Krieger.}
The first group of rules involve rearranging structures to accommodate
cache geometry:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Place read-mostly data far from frequently updated data.
	For example, place read-mostly data at the beginning of the
	structure and frequently updated data at the end.
	Place data that is rarely accessed in between.
\item	If the structure has groups of fields such that each group is
	updated by an independent code path, separate these groups
	from each other.
	Again, it can be helpful to place rarely accessed data
	between the groups.
	In some cases, it might also make sense to place each such group
	into a separate structure referenced by the original structure.
\item	Where possible, associate update-mostly data with a CPU, thread,
	or task.
	We saw several very effective examples of this rule of thumb
	in the counter implementations in
	\cref{chp:Counting}.
\item	Going one step further, partition your data on a per-CPU,
	per-thread, or per-task basis, as was discussed in
	\cref{chp:Data Ownership}.
\end{enumerate}

There has been some work towards automated trace-based rearrangement
of structure
fields~\cite{Golovanevsky:2010:TDL:2174824.2174835}.
This work might well ease one of the more painstaking tasks
required to get excellent performance and scalability from
multithreaded software.

An additional set of rules of thumb deal with locks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Given a heavily contended lock protecting data that is
	frequently modified, take one of the following approaches:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Place the lock in a different cacheline than the data
		that it protects.
	\item	Use a lock that is adapted for high contention, such
		as a queued lock.
	\item	Redesign to reduce lock contention.
		(This approach is best, but is not always trivial.)
	\end{enumerate}
\item	Place uncontended locks into the same cache line as the data
	that they protect.
	This approach means that the cache miss that brings the
	lock to the current CPU also brings its data.
\item	Protect read-mostly data with \IX{hazard pointer}s, RCU, or, for
	long-duration critical sections, reader-writer locks.
\end{enumerate}

Of course, these are rules of thumb rather than absolute rules.
Some experimentation is required to work out which are most applicable
to a given situation.

\section{Refurbish Reference Counting}
\label{sec:together:Refurbish Reference Counting}
%
\epigraph{Counting is the religion of this generation.
	  It is its hope and its salvation.}
	 {Gertrude Stein}

Although reference counting is a conceptually simple technique,
many devils hide in the details when it is applied to concurrent
software.
After all, if the object was not subject to premature disposal,
there would be no need for the
\IXalt{reference counter}{reference count} in the first place.
But if the object can be disposed of, what prevents disposal during
the reference-acquisition process itself?

There are a number of ways to refurbish reference counters for
use in concurrent software, including:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	A lock residing outside of the object must be held while
	manipulating the reference count.
\item	The object is created with a non-zero reference count, and new
	references may be acquired only when the current value of
	the reference counter is non-zero.
	If a thread does not have a reference to a given object, it
	might seek help from another thread that already has a reference.
\item	In some cases, hazard pointers may be used as a drop-in
	replacement for reference counters.
\item	An \IX{existence guarantee} is provided for the object, thus preventing
	it from being freed while some other entity might be attempting
	to acquire a reference.
	Existence guarantees are often provided by automatic
	garbage collectors, and, as is seen in
	\cref{sec:defer:Hazard Pointers,sec:defer:Read-Copy Update (RCU)},
	by hazard pointers and RCU, respectively.
\item	A \IXalt{type-safety guarantee}{type-safe memory}
	is provided for the object.
	An additional identity check must be performed once
	the reference is acquired.
	Type-safety guarantees can be provided by special-purpose
	memory allocators, for example, by the
	\co{SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU} feature within the Linux kernel,
	as is seen in \cref{sec:defer:Read-Copy Update (RCU)}.
\end{enumerate}

Of course, any mechanism that provides existence guarantees
by definition also provides type-safety guarantees.
This results in four general categories of reference-acquisition
protection:
Reference counting, hazard pointers, sequence locking, and RCU\@.

\QuickQuiz{
	Why not implement reference-acquisition using
	a simple \IXacrml{cas} operation that only
	acquires a reference if the reference counter is
	non-zero?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Although this can resolve the race between the release of
	the last reference and acquisition of a new reference,
	it does absolutely nothing to prevent the data structure
	from being freed and reallocated, possibly as some completely
	different type of structure.
	It is quite likely that the ``simple \acrml{cas}
	operation'' would give undefined results if applied to the
	differently typed structure.

	In short, use of atomic operations such as \acrml{cas}
	absolutely requires either type-safety or existence guarantees.

	But what if it is absolutely necessary to let the type change?

	One approach is for each such type to have the reference counter
	at the same location, so that as long as the reallocation results
	in an object from this group of types, all is well.
	If you do this in C, make sure you comment the reference counter
	in each structure in which it appears.
	In C++, use inheritance and templates.

\caption{Synchronizing Reference Counting}
\label{tab:together:Synchronizing Reference Counting}
\end{table}

Given that the key reference-counting issue
is synchronization between acquisition
of a reference and freeing of the object, we have nine possible
combinations of mechanisms, as shown in
\cref{tab:together:Synchronizing Reference Counting}.
This table
divides reference-counting mechanisms into the following broad categories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	Simple counting with neither atomic operations,
	\IXpl{memory barrier}, nor alignment constraints (``$-$'').
\item	Atomic counting without memory barriers (``A'').
\item	Atomic counting, with memory barriers required only on release
	(``AM'').
\item	Atomic counting with a check combined with the atomic acquisition
	operation, and with memory barriers required only on release
	(``CAM'').
\item	Atomic counting with a check combined with the atomic acquisition
	operation (``CA'').
\item	Simple counting with a check combined with full memory barriers
	(``M'').
\item	Atomic counting with a check combined with the atomic acquisition
	operation, and with memory barriers also required on acquisition
	(``MCA'').
\end{enumerate}
However, because all Linux-kernel atomic operations that return a
value are defined to contain memory barriers,\footnote{
	With \co{atomic_read()} and \co{ATOMIC_INIT()} being the
	exceptions that prove the rule.}
all release operations
contain memory barriers, and all checked acquisition operations also
contain memory barriers.
Therefore, cases ``CA'' and ``MCA'' are equivalent to ``CAM'', so that
there are sections below for only the first four cases and the sixth case:
``$-$'', ``A'', ``AM'', ``CAM'', and ``M\@''.
Later sections describe optimizations that can improve performance
if reference acquisition and release is very frequent, and the
reference count need be checked for zero only very rarely.

\subsection{Implementation of Reference-Counting Categories}
\label{sec:together:Implementation of Reference-Counting Categories}

Simple counting protected by locking (``$-$'') is described in
\cref{sec:together:Simple Counting},
atomic counting with no memory barriers (``A'') is described in
\cref{sec:together:Atomic Counting},
atomic counting with acquisition memory barrier (``AM'') is described in
\cref{sec:together:Atomic Counting With Release Memory Barrier},
and
atomic counting with check and release memory barrier (``CAM'') is described in
\cref{sec:together:Atomic Counting With Check and Release Memory Barrier}.
Use of hazard pointers is described in
\cref{sec:defer:Hazard Pointers}
on \cpageref{sec:defer:Hazard Pointers}
and in
\cref{sec:together:Hazard-Pointer Helpers}.

\subsubsection{Simple Counting}
\label{sec:together:Simple Counting}

Simple counting, with neither atomic operations nor memory barriers,
can be used when the reference-counter acquisition and release are
both protected by the same lock.
In this case, it should be clear that the reference count itself
may be manipulated non-atomically, because the lock provides any
necessary exclusion, memory barriers, atomic instructions, and disabling
of compiler optimizations.
This is the method of choice when the lock is required to protect
other operations in addition to the reference count, but where
a reference to the object must be held after the lock is released.
\Cref{lst:together:Simple Reference-Count API} shows a simple
API that might be used to implement simple non-atomic reference
counting---although simple reference counting is almost always
open-coded instead.

\begin{listing}
\begin{fcvlabel}[ln:together:Simple Reference-Count API]
\begin{VerbatimL}[commandchars=\\\[\]]
struct sref {
	int refcount;
};

void sref_init(struct sref *sref)
{

{
	sref->refcount++;
}

int sref_put(struct sref *sref,
             void (*release)(struct sref *sref))
{
	WARN_ON(release == NULL);
	WARN_ON(release == (void (*)(struct sref *))kfree);

	if (--sref->refcount == 0) {
		release(sref);
		return 1;
	}
	return 0;
}
\end{VerbatimL}
\end{fcvlabel}
\caption{Simple Reference-Count API}
\label{lst:together:Simple Reference-Count API}
\end{listing}

\subsubsection{Atomic Counting}
\label{sec:together:Atomic Counting}

Simple atomic counting may be used in cases where any CPU acquiring
a reference must already hold a reference.
This style is used when a single CPU creates an object for its own private
use, but must allow for accesses from other CPUs, tasks, timer handlers,
and so on.
Any CPU that hands the object off must first acquire a new reference on
behalf of the recipient on the one hand, or refrain from further accesses
after the handoff on the other.
In the Linux kernel, the \co{kref} primitives are used to implement
this style of reference counting, as shown in
\cref{lst:together:Linux Kernel kref API}.\footnote{
	As of Linux v4.10.
	Linux v4.11 introduced a \co{refcount_t} API that improves
	efficiency weakly ordered platforms, but which is functionally
	equivalent to the \co{atomic_t} that it replaced.}

Atomic counting is required in this case because locking does not protect
all reference-count operations, which means that two different CPUs
might concurrently manipulate the reference count.
If normal increment and decrement were used, a pair of CPUs might both
fetch the reference count concurrently, perhaps both obtaining
the value ``3''.
If both of them increment their value, they will both obtain ``4'',
and both will store this value back into the counter.
Since the new value of the counter should instead be ``5'', one
of the increments has been lost.
Therefore, atomic operations must be used both for counter increments
and for counter decrements.

If releases are guarded by locking, hazard pointers, or RCU,
memory barriers are \emph{not} required, but for different reasons.
In the case of locking, the locks provide any needed memory barriers
(and disabling of compiler optimizations), and the locks also
prevent a pair of releases from running concurrently.
In the case of hazard pointers and RCU, cleanup will be deferred,
and any needed memory barriers or disabling of compiler optimizations
will be provided by the hazard-pointers or RCU infrastructure.
Therefore, if two CPUs release the final two references concurrently, the
actual cleanup will be deferred until both CPUs have released their hazard
pointers or exited their RCU read-side critical sections, respectively.

\QuickQuiz{
	Why isn't it necessary to guard against cases where one CPU
	acquires a reference just after another CPU releases the last
	reference?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Because a CPU must already hold a reference in order to legally
	acquire another reference.
	Therefore, if one CPU releases the last reference, there had
	better not be any CPU acquiring a new reference!

\begin{fcvref}[ln:together:Linux Kernel kref API]
The \co{kref} structure itself, consisting of a single atomic
data item, is shown in \clnrefrange{kref:b}{kref:e} of
\cref{lst:together:Linux Kernel kref API}.
The \co{kref_init()} function on \clnrefrange{init:b}{init:e}
initializes the counter to the value ``1''.
Note that the \co{atomic_set()} primitive is a simple
assignment, the name stems from the data type of \co{atomic_t}
rather than from the operation.
The \co{kref_init()} function must be invoked during object creation,
before the object has been made available to any other CPU\@.

The \co{kref_get()} function on \clnrefrange{get:b}{get:e}
unconditionally atomically increments the counter.
The \co{atomic_inc()} primitive does not necessarily explicitly
disable compiler
optimizations on all platforms, but the fact that the \co{kref}
primitives are in a separate module and that the Linux kernel build
process does no cross-module optimizations has the same effect.

The \co{kref_sub()} function on \clnrefrange{sub:b}{sub:e}
atomically decrements the
counter, and if the result is zero, \clnref{rel} invokes the specified
\co{release()} function and \clnref{ret:1} returns, informing the caller
that \co{release()} was invoked.
Otherwise, \co{kref_sub()} returns zero, informing the caller that
\co{release()} was not called.

	This cannot happen if these functions are used correctly.

	The caller cannot rely on the continued existence of the

	continue to exist.

\subsubsection{Atomic Counting With Release Memory Barrier}
\label{sec:together:Atomic Counting With Release Memory Barrier}

Atomic reference counting with release memory barriers is used by the
Linux kernel's networking layer to track the destination caches that
are used in packet routing.
The actual implementation is quite a bit more involved; this section
focuses on the aspects of \co{struct dst_entry} reference-count
handling that matches this use case,
shown in \cref{lst:together:Linux Kernel dst-clone API}.\footnote{
	As of Linux v4.13.
	Linux v4.14 added a level of indirection to permit more
	comprehensive debugging checks, but the overall effect in the
	absence of bugs is identical.}

\begin{listing}
\begin{fcvlabel}[ln:together:Linux Kernel dst-clone API]
\begin{VerbatimL}[commandchars=\\\[\]]
static inline
struct dst_entry * dst_clone(struct dst_entry * dst)
{
	if (dst)
		atomic_inc(&dst->__refcnt);
	return dst;
}

static inline
void dst_release(struct dst_entry * dst)
{
	if (dst) {
		WARN_ON(atomic_read(&dst->__refcnt) < 1);
		smp_mb__before_atomic_dec();		\lnlbl[mb]
		atomic_dec(&dst->__refcnt);
	}
}
\end{VerbatimL}
\end{fcvlabel}
\caption{Linux Kernel \tco{dst_clone} API}
\label{lst:together:Linux Kernel dst-clone API}
\end{listing}

The \co{dst_clone()} primitive may be used if the caller
already has a reference to the specified \co{dst_entry},
in which case it obtains another reference that may be handed off
to some other entity within the kernel.
Because a reference is already held by the caller, \co{dst_clone()}
need not execute any memory barriers.
The act of handing the \co{dst_entry} to some other entity might
or might not require a memory barrier, but if such a memory barrier
is required, it will be embedded in the mechanism used to hand the
\co{dst_entry} off.

\begin{fcvref}[ln:together:Linux Kernel dst-clone API]
The \co{dst_release()} primitive may be invoked from any environment,
and the caller might well reference elements of the \co{dst_entry}
structure immediately prior to the call to \co{dst_release()}.
The \co{dst_release()} primitive therefore contains a memory
barrier on \clnref{mb} preventing both the compiler and the CPU
from misordering accesses.
\end{fcvref}

Please note that the programmer making use of \co{dst_clone()} and
\co{dst_release()} need not be aware of the memory barriers, only
of the rules for using these two primitives.

\subsubsection{Atomic Counting With Check and Release Memory Barrier}
\label{sec:together:Atomic Counting With Check and Release Memory Barrier}

Consider a situation where the caller must be able to acquire a new
reference to an object to which it does not already hold a reference,
but where that object's existence is guaranteed.
The fact that initial reference-count acquisition can now run concurrently
with reference-count release adds further complications.
Suppose that a reference-count release finds that the new
value of the reference count is zero, signaling that it is
now safe to clean up the reference-counted object.
We clearly cannot allow a reference-count acquisition to
start after such clean-up has commenced, so the acquisition
must include a check for a zero reference count.
This check must be part of the atomic increment operation,
as shown below.

\QuickQuiz{
	Why can't the check for a zero reference count be
	made in a simple ``if'' statement with an atomic
	increment in its ``then'' clause?
}\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Suppose that the ``if'' condition completed, finding
	the reference counter value equal to one.
	Suppose that a release operation executes, decrementing
	the reference counter to zero and therefore starting
	cleanup operations.
	But now the ``then'' clause can increment the counter
	back to a value of one, allowing the object to be
	used after it has been cleaned up.

	This use-after-cleanup bug is every bit as bad as a
	full-fledged use-after-free bug.
}\QuickQuizEnd

The Linux kernel's \co{fget()} and \co{fput()} primitives
use this style of reference counting.
Simplified versions of these functions are shown in
\cref{lst:together:Linux Kernel fget/fput API}.\footnote{
	As of Linux v2.6.38.
	Additional \co{O_PATH} functionality was added in v2.6.39,
	refactoring was applied in v3.14, and \co{mmap_sem} contention
	was reduced in v4.1.}

\begin{fcvref}[ln:together:Linux Kernel fget/fput API]
\Clnref{fetch} of \co{fget()} fetches the pointer to the current
process's file-descriptor table, which might well be shared
with other processes.
\Clnref{rrl} invokes \co{rcu_read_lock()}, which
enters an RCU read-side critical section.
The callback function from any subsequent \co{call_rcu()} primitive
will be deferred until a matching \co{rcu_read_unlock()} is reached
(\clnref{rru1} or~\lnref{rru2} in this example).
\Clnref{lookup} looks up the file structure corresponding to the file
descriptor specified by the \co{fd} argument, as will be
described later.
If there is an open file corresponding to the specified file descriptor,
then \clnref{acq} attempts to atomically acquire a reference count.
If it fails to do so, \clnrefrange{rru1}{ret:null} exit the RCU read-side critical
section and report failure.
Otherwise, if the attempt is successful, \clnrefrange{rru2}{ret:file}
exit the read-side
critical section and return a pointer to the file structure.

The \co{fcheck_files()} primitive is a helper function for
\co{fget()}.
\Clnref{deref:fdt} uses \co{rcu_dereference()} to safely fetch an
RCU-protected pointer to this task's current file-descriptor table,
and \clnref{range} checks to see if the specified file descriptor is in range.
If so, \clnref{deref:fd} fetches the pointer to the file structure, again using
the \co{rcu_dereference()} primitive.
\Clnref{ret:file2} then returns a pointer to the file structure or \co{NULL}
in case of failure.

The \co{fput()} primitive releases a reference to a file structure.
\Clnref{dec} atomically decrements the reference count, and, if the
result was zero, \clnref{call} invokes the \co{call_rcu()} primitives
in order to free up the file structure (via the \co{file_free_rcu()}
function specified in \co{call_rcu()}'s second argument), but only after
all currently-executing RCU read-side critical sections complete, that
is, after an RCU \IX{grace period} has elapsed.

Once the grace period completes, the \co{file_free_rcu()} function
obtains a pointer to the file structure on \clnref{obtain}, and frees it
on \clnref{free}.
\end{fcvref}

This code fragment thus demonstrates how RCU can be used to guarantee
existence while an in-object reference count is being incremented.

\subsection{Counter Optimizations}
\label{sec:together:Counter Optimizations}

In some cases where increments and decrements are common, but checks
for zero are rare, it makes sense to maintain per-CPU or per-task
counters, as was discussed in \cref{chp:Counting}.
For example, see the paper on sleepable read-copy update (SRCU), which
applies this technique to RCU~\cite{PaulEMcKenney2006c}.
This approach eliminates the need for atomic instructions or memory
barriers on the increment and decrement primitives, but still requires
that code-motion compiler optimizations be disabled.
In addition, the primitives such as \co{synchronize_srcu()}
that check for the aggregate reference
count reaching zero can be quite slow.
This underscores the fact that these techniques are designed
for situations where the references are frequently acquired and
released, but where it is rarely necessary to check for a zero
reference count.

However, it is usually the case that use of reference counts requires
writing (often atomically) to a data structure that is otherwise
read only.
In this case, reference counts are imposing expensive cache misses
on readers.

It is therefore worthwhile to look into synchronization mechanisms
that do not require readers to write to the data structure being
traversed.
One possibility is the hazard pointers covered in
\cref{sec:defer:Hazard Pointers}
and another is RCU, which is covered in
\cref{sec:defer:Read-Copy Update (RCU)}.

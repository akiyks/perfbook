To prevent a pair of closely related figures or listings
from being placed in different pages, it is desirable to group
them into a single floating object.
The ``subcaption'' package provides the features to do so.\footnote{
  One problem of grouping figures might be the complexity in
  \LaTeX\ source.}

The example of grouping figures in this section uses \co{subcaptionblock}
environment available in subcaption v1.5 or later.

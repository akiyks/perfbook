The sub\-/caption can be cited by a \verb|\cref{}| macro, for example,
``\cref{sublst:app:styleguide:Enforcing Order}''.
Note the difference in the resulting format.
For the citing by a \verb|\cref{}| to work, you need to place
the \verb|\label{}| macro of the combined floating object
ahead of the definition of sub-listings.
Otherwise, the resulting caption number would be off by one
from the actual number.
